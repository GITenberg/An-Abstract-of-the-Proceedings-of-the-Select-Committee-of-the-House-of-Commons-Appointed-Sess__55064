<p>As the circumstances connected with the origin and progress of the Peninsular
and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and particularly with its
employment in the Contract Mail Packet Service, are but imperfectly known
to a great proportion of the present Proprietors; for their better information
it has been deemed advisable by the Directors to authorise the printing and
circulation of the following Statement and Abstract.</p>

<p>References, it will be found, are occasionally made to parts of the proceedings
of the Select Committee of the House of Commons, which have not
been printed in this pamphlet, because they would have rendered it too bulky
for convenient perusal. But those who may wish to examine these proceedings
at length, can procure the Parliamentary Blue Book at Hansard’s
offices for the sale of Parliamentary Papers.

<span class="medium"><i>&amp;c., &amp;c.</i></span>

<img class="figcenter" src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></h2>

<p>In their last Report, presented to the Proprietors at
the general meeting held on the 31st of May last, the
Directors stated that a Committee of the House of
Commons had been appointed, “to inquire into the
Contract Packet Service;” and expressed “their satisfaction
that such an inquiry had been instituted, feeling,
as they did, that as far as the interests of this Company
were concerned, it would have a beneficial tendency, by
eliciting facts connected with the origin and progress of
the Company, and its employment in the Contract Mail
Service, which could not fail to show the important
national benefits which it has been the means of realising,
and its consequent claim to public support.”</p>

<p>It is no doubt known to some Proprietors of the
Company, that for several years past statements have
been made, and circulated with untiring pertinacity, to
the effect, that the Contracts made by the Government
with this Company for the Mail Packet Service had been
obtained through undue favouritism, or corrupt jobbing<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>&mdash;that
fair competition had been denied to other parties,&mdash;and
that the Company had, in consequence, obtained
a much larger remuneration for the Service than ought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
to have been given, and were deriving enormous profits
from it.</p>

<p>Although the Directors were aware that these misstatements
had obtained some attention, even in influential
quarters, they probably did not consider it was consistent
with the eminent position which the Company occupies
to take any legal proceedings against, or to enter into
any public controversy with, the parties who had been
chiefly instrumental in propagating them.</p>

<p>The forbearance of the Directors has led to a highly
satisfactory result. The continued propagation of these
misstatements at last attracted the attention of a member
of the House of Commons so far as to induce that
honourable gentleman to move for a Select Committee
to inquire into the Contract Packet Service.</p>

<p>Although the Committee was moved for and appointed
ostensibly to inquire into the Service generally, its principal
object was, as is sufficiently obvious from its proceedings,
to investigate the Contracts and transactions of
the Peninsular and Oriental Company. And the earlier
part of the proceedings of the Committee also show that
the honourable mover and Chairman of it, actuated, no
doubt, by a sense of public duty, entertained, at first, no
very friendly views on the subject in reference to this
Company.</p>

<p>The facts elicited in the course of the inquiry, and the
glaring self-contradictions exhibited by the principal witness,
when brought to the test of an examination before
the Committee, as well as the hostile tone adopted by him
towards this Company, appear, however, to have satisfied
the honourable gentleman that, while induced to believe
that he was prosecuting a public object, and undertaking
a public duty, he had been made use of, for the mere
gratification of private feeling.</p>

<p>And the following two first paragraphs of the Committee’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
Report, which was drafted and proposed by the
honourable member himself, are a sufficient refutation of
the misstatements which led to the inquiry.</p>

<p>1. “That so far as the Committee are able to judge, from the
evidence they have taken, it appears that the Mails are conveyed
at a less cost by hired packets than by Her Majesty’s vessels.</p>

<p>2. “That some of the existing Contracts have been put up to
public tender, and some arranged by private negotiation; and
that a very large sum beyond what is received from postage is
paid on some of the lines; but, considering that at the time
these Contracts were arranged the success of these large undertakings
was uncertain, your Committee see no reason to think
better terms could have been obtained for the public.”</p>

<p>As the detached and inconsecutive form in which the
evidence of the different officers of the Government
departments was given to the Committee does not afford
a very clear view of the history of the connexion of this
Company with the Contract Packet Service&mdash;and, in
particular, does not show the important public advantages
which have been derived from the undertaking of these
services by the Company&mdash;it is considered expedient,
previously to proceeding with the abstract of the Committee’s
proceedings, to give a brief consecutive statement
of the circumstances under which the various branches of
the Contract Packet Service were undertaken by the
Company. And first,</p>

<h2>No. I.<br />

THE PENINSULAR MAILS.</h2>

<p>Previous to the 4th of September, 1837, the arrangements
for the Mail Packet communication with the
Peninsula were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mails to Lisbon were conveyed by sailing Post-office
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Packets, which departed from Falmouth for Lisbon
every week&mdash;wind and weather permitting. Their
departures and arrivals were, however, extremely irregular;
and it was no very infrequent occurrence for the
Lisbon Mail to be three weeks’ old on its arrival at
Falmouth, instead of being brought in five days, with an
almost mail-coach or railway precision, as is now the
case.</p>

<p>The communication with Cadiz and Gibraltar was only
once a month by a steam packet.</p>

<p>The originators and original proprietors of the Peninsular
Steam Company, who had, for upwards of a year
previously to the time above mentioned, been running
steam vessels at a considerable loss between London and
the principal Peninsular ports, finding themselves in a
position to effect a great improvement in the arrangements
for transmitting the Mails, applied to the Government of
that day on the subject, but were at first coldly received,
and their suggestions disregarded. They continued,
however, to prosecute their enterprise; and the celerity
and regularity with which their steam packets made their
passages soon began to attract the attention of the public.
The merchants began to complain loudly of the inefficiency
of the transmission of the Mails by sailing
packets; and it was at last intimated, from an official
quarter, to the Managers of the Peninsular steamers,
that if they had any plan or proposals to submit for an
improvement of the Peninsular Mail Service, the Government
was then prepared to receive and consider the same.</p>

<p>In consequence of this intimation, a plan and proposal
was drawn up for a weekly transmission of the Mails
between Falmouth and Vigo, Oporto, Lisbon, Cadiz, and
Gibraltar, by efficient steam packets, and at a cost to
the public which should be less than that of the then
existing inferior arrangement&mdash;namely, sailing packets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
to and from the Port of Lisbon, and a steam packet,
once a month only, to and from Cadiz and Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The plan, after due examination, was considered to
embrace advantages to the public far exceeding what the
then existing arrangements afforded; and its adoption
was consequently intimated to the authors and proposers
of it; but, at the same time, they were informed that the
execution of it would be put up to public competition.</p>

<p>Accordingly, an advertisement was soon afterwards
issued, inviting tenders, from owners of steam vessels,
for conveying the Mails between Falmouth and the
Peninsula, in conformity with the plan submitted by the
Peninsular Company; and the Contract for the Service
was competed for against that Company by the proprietors
of some steam vessels, who, under the designation of the
British and Foreign Steam Navigation Company, had
a short time previously commenced running two small
steamers to the Peninsula, in opposition to the Peninsular
Company’s vessels.</p>

<p>This British and Foreign Company, not being able to
satisfy the Admiralty that they had the means of performing
the proposed Service, their tender was rejected.
Upon which they addressed the Admiralty, and requested
that the Contract might be postponed, alleging, that if a
month more were given to them, they could provide
sufficient vessels. Their request was granted; and,
contrary to all previous practice, after the tender of the
Peninsular Company had been given in, and the amount
of it, in all probability, known to their competitors, the
Contract was again advertised, and a month more given
for receiving tenders.</p>

<p>The British and Foreign Company again failed to
show that they had any adequate means of performing
the Service; and a private negotiation was then entered
into by the Government, with the Peninsular Company,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
with a view to reduce the sum required by them. This
sum was £30,000 per annum, being about £5,000 less
than the estimated annual cost to the public of the sailing
packets and steam packet previously employed in conveying
the Mails. This sum was ultimately reduced to
£29,600,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> on which terms the Contract was concluded on
the 22nd August, 1837, and may be considered to have
formed the basis upon which one of the most extensive
and successful steam enterprises yet known has been
established.</p>

<p>These facts, it is submitted, abundantly show, that so
far from any favour being shown, in regard to this
Contract, to the originators of this Company, they
obtained it in the face of adverse circumstances, and
solely because they had, by their own enterprise, placed
themselves in a position to effect an important public
improvement, combined with a reduction of the public
expenditure.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>No. II.<br />

<span class="hang"><i>Contract for an accelerated Conveyance of the
India and other Mails between England and
Malta, and Alexandria.</i></span>

<img class="figcenter" src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" />

COMMENCED SEPTEMBER 1<small>ST</small>, 1840.

<img class="figcenter" src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></h2>

<p>The efficiency with which the Peninsular Mail Packet
Service was performed elicited from the Admiralty
repeated testimonials of approbation; and, proving as it
did, that that description of service could be more advantageously
conducted by private enterprise, under Contract,
than by Government vessels and establishments, paved
the way for the subsequent extension of Contract Mail
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
communication which took place with the West Indies,
North America and the East Indies, China, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Previous to the 1st of September, 1840, the arrangements
for transmitting the India Mails to and from Egypt,
to meet the East India Company’s steamers plying
monthly between Bombay and Suez, were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>These Malls were forwarded, every fourth Saturday,
by the Contract Mail steamers of the Peninsular Company
to Gibraltar, and there transferred to an Admiralty
steam packet, which carried them to Malta. They
were there transferred to another Admiralty packet,
which carried them to Alexandria. The homeward
Mails were brought in a similar manner.</p>

<p>As the Peninsular packets had to call at Vigo,
Oporto, Lisbon, and Cadiz, in their passage to and from
Gibraltar, and the Government packets were of inferior
power (about 140 horses) and speed, the transmission of
the India Mails by this route was very tardy, occupying
generally from three weeks to a month in their passage
between England and Alexandria.</p>

<p>Imperfect as this mode of transmission was, it probably
would have been continued for an indefinite period, had
not some circumstances occurred to render an alteration
of it imperative.</p>

<p>About the middle of the year 1839, the British
Government effected a convention with the French
Government, for transmitting letters and despatches to
and from India, &amp;c., overland, through France, <i>viâ</i>
Marseilles, from whence a British Admiralty packet
conveyed them to Malta. From thence this portion of
the Mail, and the larger and heavier portion, forwarded
by the Peninsular and Admiralty packets, <i>viâ</i> Gibraltar,
were carried together to Alexandria by another Admiralty
packet.</p>

<p>The portion of the Mails forwarded through France
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
was despatched from the Post-office on the 4th of every
month, while the main, or heavier portion, continued to
be forwarded from Falmouth, by the Peninsular packets,
every fourth Saturday; this arrangement was found, in
the course of a few months, to work very awkwardly,
inasmuch as the portion of the Mail forwarded, <i>viâ</i>
Gibraltar, had become a fortnight or more in advance
of that forwarded <i>viâ</i> Marseilles, and had to wait that
time at Malta for the arrival of the Marseilles packet.</p>

<p>This irregularity, which every succeeding Mail increased,
together with the suspicion that the British
despatches, in their transit through France, were not
altogether safe from being tampered with, rendered the
Government very desirous of establishing a more accelerated
means of transmission, <i>viâ</i> Gibraltar, for the main
portion of the India Mails and the public despatches.</p>

<p>The Managers of the Peninsular steamers were applied
to, to submit a plan for this object. They proposed to
establish a line of large and powerful steamers, to run
direct from England to Alexandria, and <i>vice versa</i>, touching
at Gibraltar and Malta only, and, by such an arrangement,
to transmit the Mails in a time that should not exceed by
more than two to three days that occupied by the overland
route through France; and undertook to execute
such service, with vessels of 450-horse power, for a sum
which should not exceed the cost to the public of the
small and inefficient Admiralty packets then employed in
the same service.</p>

<p>The plan was examined and adopted by the Government;
but, as in the case of the Peninsular Contract, the
execution of it was put up to public tender, by advertisement.
And, as appears by the evidence of Mr. T. C.
Croker, of the Admiralty (see his answer to question
No. 2,033), no less than four competitors tendered for the
Contract, viz.:&mdash;

<p>The tender of Messrs. Willcox and Anderson who, as
Managers of the Peninsular Company, had furnished the
plan, was accepted, <i>because it was the lowest</i>. But Mr.

<p>Besides this reduced sum, as compared with the
demands of the other competitors, the tender of Willcox
and Anderson afforded further important advantages to
the public, in a reduced rate of passage-money for officers
travelling on the public service, conveyance free of
Admiralty packages, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The vessels offered by Willcox and Anderson, were the
“Oriental,” of 1,600 tons, and 450-horse power, and the
“Great Liverpool,” of 1,540 tons, and 464-horse power,
(originally destined for the transatlantic line of communication,
but which were placed at their disposal by the
Managers and Proprietors of that enterprise). They
were also bound to provide a subsidiary vessel, of not
less than 250-horse power, besides a vessel of 140-horse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
power, for the Malta and Corfu Service. The estimate
made at the Admiralty (see question No. 1411) of the
cost of the Government packets which performed the
service, and which were superseded by this Contract, was
£33,912. But as that estimate did not include any
allowance for interest on their first cost, nor for sea risk,
nor for depreciation, the following per centages on these
accounts must be added to it, in order to present a
tolerably correct view of the actual cost to the public of
the service so performed.</p>

<p>The four vessels employed could not have cost the
public less than £100,000. Upon this sum, therefore,
must be calculated&mdash;</p>

<p>It hence appears that this Service, which cost, in the
defective state of its arrangements, and as carried on by
small vessels of about 140-horse power, £44,912, was
undertaken, and has since been satisfactorily performed,
under a greatly improved arrangement, by large vessels
of 450-horse power, for £34,200, realising a financial
saving of about £10,700 per annum to the country.

<h2>No. III.<br />

<span class="hang"><i>Contract for conveying Mails between Suez and
Aden, Ceylon, Madras, Calcutta, Penang,
Singapore, and Hong Kong.</i></span>

COMMENCED JANUARY <span class="smcap">1st</span>, 1845.

<img class="figcenter" src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></h2>

<p>For several years prior to the arrangement of the
Contract with this Company, for the accelerated transmission
of the India Mails to and from Alexandria, much
public solicitude had been manifested for a more comprehensive
system of steam communication with India
than that which had been established by the Government
and the East India Company. That establishment being
considered, as, indeed, at its commencement it was professed
to be, merely a preliminary and experimental one&mdash;intended
to pave the way for a more comprehensive
scheme, that should embrace all the Presidencies, and
not be limited to the port of Bombay only, as the
Government and East India Line was,&mdash;and which it
was expected private enterprise would undertake, after
the navigation of the Red Sea, and other important
questions connected with such an undertaking, had been
tested by the Imperial and Indian Governments.</p>

<p>As a proof of the importance which was attached to
this extension of steam communication with British India,
the following declarations of eminent persons connected
with the Government of that empire may be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>The late Lord William Bentinck, then Governor-General
of India, stated, in a public despatch, that so
great were the advantages which it would confer, “that
it would be cheaply purchased at any price.” The present
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Right Honourable President of the India Board, Sir
John Cam Hobhouse, who then filed the same post, in
speaking in the House of Commons of various ameliorations
which the Government he was then connected with
had in view for India, in which improved steam communication
formed an item, said, that “it was calculated
to benefit India to an extent beyond the power of the
most ardent imagination to conceive.” And the present
Lord Bishop of Calcutta, in a public address at a meeting
in that city, said, that “the extension of steam navigation
with India would be opening the floodgates of measureless
blessings to mankind.”</p>

<p>Various attempts, however, under the sanction of eminent
merchants, and other influential parties connected
with India, to form a Company and establish the so much-desired
scheme having failed, the parties who had been
instrumental in establishing the Peninsular Company,
and the accelerated conveyance for the India Mails to
Alexandria, feeling that they had placed themselves in a
position to effect this important national object, resolved
to adopt it as a part of their enterprise, which they
thenceforth designated “The Peninsular and Oriental
Steam Navigation Company.” It was accordingly
formed into a joint-stock Company, and a Charter of
Incorporation from the Crown was applied for, which,
after considerable opposition from other parties, was
granted&mdash;but subject to the following conditions, namely,
“That the Company should open an improved steam
communication with India throughout, from England,
within two years from the date of the Charter, or it
should be null. That all steam vessels to be constructed
by the Company of 400-horse power, and upwards,
should be so strengthened and otherwise arranged as to
carry and fire guns of the largest calibre then used in
Her Majesty’s steam vessels of war. That the Government
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
should have a power of inspection, as to their
being maintained in good and efficient sea-worthy condition,
and that the Company should not sell any of such
vessels without giving the pre-emption of purchase to
the Government.”</p>

<p>The Company under this Charter having obtained
the necessary additional capital, and being joined also
by most of the parties who had previously been endeavouring
to effect this object under the designation of
“The East India Steam Navigation Company,” proceeded,
with all practicable speed, to fulfil the conditions,
and carry out the object of their Charter of Incorporation.</p>

<p>On the 24th September, 1842, their first vessel destined
for the India Sea service, the “Hindostan,” of 1800 tons,
and 520-horse power, constructed at Liverpool, at a
cost of £88,000, was despatched from Southampton for
Calcutta, to open the “Comprehensive” line of communication,
by plying between Calcutta, Madras, Ceylon, and
Suez.</p>

<p>The commencement of this communication, by so large
and powerful a vessel, was looked upon as a public event,
and the ship was visited by members of the then Government,
Directors of the Honourable East India Company,
and many other eminent individuals.</p>

<p>It may here be necessary to advert to a circumstance
which has been made the subject of much misrepresentation,
and was even attempted, although without success,
to be misrepresented to the Parliamentary Committee.
(See evidence of Mr. Andrew Henderson in the Report,
questions 2200 to 2208, and 2333, and 2334; also, correspondence
between the East India Company and the
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, in
the Appendix, page 224 to 227.)</p>

<p>The circumstance alluded to was this:&mdash;The Directors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
of the East India Company, seeing that the extension of
steam communication with India was at last in the hands
of parties likely to place it on a practical basis, and
desirous to encourage it on public grounds, voluntarily
proposed to the Peninsular and Oriental Company to
give them a premium of £20,000 per annum, and to continue
the same for five years, on certain conditions, which,
if the Company should at any time neglect or decline to
fulfil, it was at the option of the East India Company to
withdraw the premium or grant.</p>

<p>The conditions were:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. That the communication with India beyond the
Isthmus of Suez should be opened, and carried on by
vessels of not less than 520-horse power, and 1600 tons
burthen.</p>

<p>2nd. That a communication between Suez and Calcutta
should be established the first year of the grant.</p>

<p>3rd. That not less than six voyages between Suez and
Calcutta should be performed, in order to entitle the
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Company to the second
year’s grant.</p>

<p>4th. That a monthly communication between those
places should be established, to entitle the Steam Company
to the third and subsequent years’ grants.</p>

<p>5th. And that in case a contract should be entered into
with the Steam Company for the conveyance of Mails, the
grant should cease, and merge into such sum as might be
paid for that service.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such were the principal conditions of an arrangement
which was attempted to be construed into a Contract, binding
the Peninsular and Oriental Company to maintain a
Monthly Mail Packet Service between Suez and India,
with vessels of 520-horse power, for five years, for
£20,000 per annum. It is, however, obvious that so far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
from such being the true construction, it was perfectly
optional to the Peninsular and Oriental Company to
discontinue the arrangement, and relinquish their claim
to the grant, whenever its continuance might be incompatible
with their interests.</p>

<p>The Company having constructed another vessel of
520-horse power and 1800 tons, the “Bentinck,” and
purchased a third new vessel, of similar power and tonnage,
the “Precursor,” considered that the time had arrived
when they might improve the postal communication with
India, upon the same principle as that upon which they
had improved the Peninsular and Mediterranean Services,
namely, by combining an important public improvement
with a reduction of the public expenditure.</p>

<p>Finding, from a return which had a short time previously
been made by the East India Company to the House of
Commons, that the cost of conveying the India Mails
between Bombay and Suez, as then performed by that Company,
with steam packets of an average power of about
200 horses each, and some of which were of inferior speed,
was not less than £110,000 per annum,&mdash;the Peninsular
and Oriental Steam Company made a proposal to the
East India Company, to relieve the latter of that Service,
and to undertake it with their vessels of 520-horse
power each; and thereby effect a considerable acceleration
in the transit of the Mails&mdash;an improvement in the accommodation,
and a reduction in the charge for passengers&mdash;a
greater facility for the conveyance of light valuable goods
and parcels&mdash;and a reduction of about £30,000 in the public
expenditure, inasmuch as the Peninsular and Oriental
Company offered to do the service for £80,000 per
annum.</p>

<p>The then Court of Directors of the East India Company
being opposed to the relinquishment of the postal
service between Bombay and Suez into the hands of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
private enterprise this proposal was not entertained; and,
the matter having engaged the attention of her Majesty’s
Government, it was ultimately arranged that the East
India Company should be allowed to retain the Packet
Service between Bombay and Suez, and that the Peninsular
and Oriental Company should submit proposals for
the establishment (under Contract with the Admiralty)
of a Monthly Mail Service between Suez, <i>viâ</i> Ceylon, and
Madras and Calcutta, with vessels of 500 horse-power;
and, in connection therewith, a monthly communication
between Ceylon, Penang, Singapore, and Hong Kong,
with vessels of 400 horse-power, thus effecting a Mail
communication twice a month with India, and a Monthly
Steam Packet communication with China.</p>

<p>After a lengthened negotiation a Contract was effected,
in virtue of which the Peninsular and Oriental Company
were to receive £115,000 per annum, equal to about 20s.
per mile, for the Suez, Ceylon, Madras, and Calcutta Service;
and £45,000 per annum, equal to about 12s. per mile,
for the Ceylon, Penang, Singapore, and China Service.</p>

<p>This Contract was not put up to public competition,
and there are obvious reasons to show why to have
done so would have been useless, and unjust. It
would have been useless, because it was well known
that there were then no vessels in existence capable
of performing such an extensive service, on the plan
proposed, except the vessels which had, in fulfilment of
the conditions of their Charter of Incorporation, been
provided by this Company expressly for the East India
Steam Communication; and it would have been unjust
to the Peninsular and Oriental Company, after they had
been induced to embark so large an amount of capital
in providing ships of a description adapted to important
national objects, not to have given them the opportunity
of executing the Service on reasonable terms.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>That the terms concluded upon were as reasonable and
advantageous to the public interests as could have been
at that time obtained, is sufficiently confirmed by the
Report of the Parliamentary Committee.</p>

<p>A few facts may, however, serve to further elucidate
this point.</p>

<p>In giving in their proposals for these Services, the
Managing Directors submitted therewith detailed estimates
of the expenses and receipts, to enable the Government
to see and examine the grounds upon which the
sums required for the Mail Service were based. And it
appears, by the evidence taken before the Committee of
the House of Commons, as well as before another Committee
of the House of Lords, on the Post-office Service,
(Session 1847,) that this part of the question was subjected
to a very close and rigid scrutiny at the Admiralty.
Also, that an estimate was made to ascertain what the
proposed Services could be done for by public vessels;
the result of which was, that it would have cost by such
means not less than 42s. 6d. per mile, (less such returns
as might be obtained from the conveyance of passengers.)</p>

<p>Looking therefore, to this estimate, and the fact that
the Bombay and Suez Service, with vessels of only about
200 horse-power, was actually costing, under the management
of the East India Company, after deducting the receipts
for passage-money, at the rate of 31s. 6d. per mile,
namely, £110,000 for 70,000 miles, the rates received by
the Peninsular and Oriental Company&mdash;being about 20s.
per mile for the Suez and Calcutta Service, and 12s. per
mile for the Ceylon and China Service, or if averaged
for the two Services together, about 17s. 1d. per mile&mdash;it
cannot be considered as exorbitant by any reasonable
or unbiassed mind; but it will rather be admitted that
the Company in this, as in the previous instances, are
entitled to take credit for effecting a great public improvement,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
at a less cost than what it could otherwise
have been obtained for.</p>

<p>The following evidence on this subject was given by
Mr. Croker, of the Admiralty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1388. Does there appear to have been any estimate made by the
Admiralty of the expense of doing that service?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>1389. When was that made, or when was it sent to the Treasury?&mdash;It
appears to have been sent to the India Board.</p>

<p>1390. At what date?&mdash;On the 20th of January, 1844; the
points upon which they gave information were, “The practicability
of the proposal made by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation
Company respecting the mode of ‘effecting the accelerated
transmission of the East India Mails and Despatches between
Bombay and Suez, combining therewith, for the year 1844, a
two-monthly communication with Calcutta and Madras.’ The
sufficiency of the means which the Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation Company proposed to employ, and the propriety of
their demand of £80,000 per annum for performing a service
which the Admiralty understood to be that then performed by
the East India Company, namely, conveying the mails by steam
vessels between Suez and Bombay monthly; and, in addition to
this, between Bombay and Calcutta every second month.” The
estimate then goes on in detail: and “With respect to the propriety
of the demand of £80,000 per annum the Admiralty
forwarded a statement from the Accountant-general of the Navy,
showing that the cost of building and equipment of the four
steam vessels required for the service, under the naval regulations
would be about £250,000, including £6,500 which the Admiralty
added to the estimate of their Accountant-general to meet additional
fittings for the necessary accommodation of passengers.
The Admiralty, however, had every reason to believe that to this
estimate of the cost, &amp;c., of the vessels, which they considered
to be absolutely necessary for the satisfactory performance of the
Mail Packet Service in the Indian seas, the outlay of the Peninsular
and Oriental Steam Navigation Company would be increased
by an additional sum of nearly £50,000, for what may be termed
the luxurious accommodation now expected by passengers. Upon
this speculation the Company, of course, subjected themselves to
a risk of loss, or corresponding advantage. With respect to the
item of coals, which was omitted in the Accountant-general’s
return, the Admiralty, in the absence of precise knowledge,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
estimated the cost upon the best information they could obtain,
and their Lordships considered the Commissioners for the Affairs
of India to be competent judges of the correctness of their
assumed estimate, as well as of the assumed cost of coal depôts,
coaling, and other incidental and contingent expenses. The item
of oil, tallow, &amp;c., was also assumed, as the consumption of these
articles depended on the construction of the engine, both as to
principle and manufacture. In explanation of the differences
between the following calculations and the Accountant-general’s
statement, the Admiralty observed, that the interest of the money
was not taken into account in naval expenditure; and that 15 per
cent. for wear and tear, and depreciation of hull and machinery,
had been adopted, with six per cent. for insurance, in compliance
with the suggestion of the India Board, for the purpose of maintaining
a comparative uniformity with the estimate given in their
Secretary’s letter of the 24th of November, founded upon the
Parliamentary documents supplied by the East India Company.
The investment the Admiralty were willing to admit for the
first cost and equipment of three first-class and one second-class
steam vessels, being £250,000; this capital, if dealt with
as suggested, would require an annual expenditure, for performing
the Mail Service between Bombay and Suez, in wages and
victuals, of £35,000; for coals (taken at 48s. per ton,) £29,000;
for oil, tallow, &amp;c., £1,500; 15 per cent. on £250,000 for wear and
tear, and depreciation of vessels and machinery, £37,000; six
per cent. insurance, £15,000; four per cent. interest on capital,
£10,000; making £128,300. To this sum of £128,000 must be
added the expenses of coal depôts at Bombay, Aden, and Suez,
and the cost of coaling the vessels at these stations, &amp;c., which,
according to the items supplied by the Parliamentary document,
ordered to be printed on 3rd July, 1843, appeared to be, for coal
depôts, £7,644; wages of mechanics and apprentices not attached
to particular vessels, expense of receiving ships, and miscellaneous
charges of the steam department, £8,594, making a total of
£16,238; thus increasing the amount of annual expenditure by
upwards of £20,000, as the Admiralty considered that at least
£4,000 difference must exist between supplying vessels of more
than double the horse power and tonnage of those of the East
India Company, making an annual outlay of £148,000 per
annum for performing a distance of 70,080 miles.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The result of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
this calculation, therefore, exhibited the comparative cost of the
Mail Service on the line between Suez and Bombay as follows:
If performed by the East India Company, in their, comparatively
speaking, small vessels, as shown by their return to Parliament,
after deducting passage-money, £108,000 per annum, which does
not appear to include the cost of coal depôts. If performed by
vessels of 500-horse power, and 1,500 tons, without deducting
passage-money, £148,000 per annum. If performed by contract,
by vessels of 500-horse power, and 1,500 tons, £80,000 per
annum. The Admiralty, in conclusion, observed, that should a
mail communication, as suggested by them, extending from Suez
to Calcutta, be determined on, the increase in the item of coals
(calculated at 33s. 6d. per ton) would be £15,000, and three
coal depôts, with the expense of coaling, &amp;c., might be taken at
£20,000 per annum, in round numbers.”</p>

<p>1391. What is the date of that report you are reading from?&mdash;It
is the report from the Select Committee of the House of Lords,
ordered to be printed 21st June, 1847.</p>

<p>1392. You spoke of vessels of 1,800 tons, and vessels of 1,500
tons; do you mean to say they were of that number each, or that
there were three vessels 600 tons each?&mdash;1,500 tons each, or
1,800 tons each, the larger class of vessels.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>1393. If I understand you, from what you have stated from that
report, the estimate of the Admiralty for the cost of their vessels,
for three first-class vessels and one second-class vessel, was
£148,000?&mdash;Yes, £148,000.</p>

<p>1394. That makes no allowance for any receipt from passengers?&mdash;It
is without deducting passage-money.</p>

<p>1395. What was the amount of passage-money deducted from
the East India Company’s account, which comes to £108,000?&mdash;That
will be shown by the Parliamentary document ordered to be
printed on the 3rd of July, 1843, I presume; It is not stated
here.</p>

<h2>No. IV.<br />

<span class="hang"><i>Contract for conveying the Bombay Branch of
the India Mails between Southampton and
Alexandria.</i></span></h2>

<p>Two Mail Communications per month with India being
thus established,&mdash;viz., that by the Peninsular and Oriental
Company to Calcutta, <i>viâ</i> Ceylon, and that by the East
India Company’s packets between Suez and Bombay,&mdash;the
Mails for the former being despatched <i>viâ</i> Southampton
on the 20th, by the Peninsular and Oriental Company’s
vessels, to meet the same Company’s vessels plying between
Suez and India, China, &amp;c.,&mdash;it became necessary
to provide a means of conveyance for the Bombay branch
of the India Mail between Southampton and Alexandria,
which had hitherto been conveyed by the Peninsular and
Oriental Company’s vessels, and was despatched from
Southampton on the 3rd of every month. The Government
required, at first, a continuous line of steam vessels,
of not less than 400-horse power, to ply between Southampton
and Alexandria, similar to that conveying the
Calcutta branch of the India Mails; and the Peninsular
and Oriental Company were called upon to submit proposals
for undertaking the Service on that plan.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>The Managing Directors represented that to undertake
the Service upon that plan would entail a heavy
expense upon the public, inasmuch as the expense of
maintaining such a communication, by such vessels, would
be equal to the expense of the Southampton and Alexandria
communication for the Calcutta branch of the Mails,
for which the public were then paying about £30,000
per annum; while the passenger traffic, <i>viâ</i> Bombay,
would be considerably less, in consequence of the obstruction
presented to the conveyance of goods, and the
high charge and inadequate accommodation for passengers
by the East India Company’s packets. In short,
that, looking to these circumstances, £40,000 per annum
would scarcely be remunerative for such an undertaking.</p>

<p>This plan was, therefore, abandoned; and, after some
others proposed by the Government had been also
abandoned, on account of the expense, or being otherwise
found impracticable, the Managing Directors submitted
a plan and proposal for transmitting the Bombay branch
of the India Mail between Southampton and Alexandria,
<i>viâ</i> Malta, <i>without causing any additional expense to the
public</i>.</p>

<p>This plan was as follows:&mdash;They proposed to convey
monthly between Southampton and Malta that branch
of the India Mails, by means of steam vessels which they
had recently placed for commercial traffic, to ply between
Southampton, Malta, Constantinople, and ports in the
Black Sea; and to provide a steam vessel to convey the
Mails between Malta and Alexandria, which should
run in concert with these Constantinople steamers,
and the East India Company’s steamers conveying
the mails between Suez and Bombay. This plan was
adopted by the Government; and, after some negotiation,
the remuneration for this Mail Service was
fixed at £15,535 per annum, or about 4s. 3d. per
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
mile, on an arrangement for twelve months only, as the
Company wished to reserve to themselves the option of
abandoning it, should it prove seriously unremunerative,
or embarrass their commercial traffic. To meet the
expense of this Service, it was proposed to the Government
to withdraw an Admiralty packet which then
formed a monthly communication between Gibraltar and
Malta; inasmuch as the steamers of this Company
plying to Constantinople, touched regularly both at
Gibraltar and Malta, on their passages out and home,
and would supply the place of that packet, by which a
saving to the public would be effected of from £7,000 to
£8,000 per annum. Also, that as, with the two lines of
India Mail steamers per month touching at Gibraltar,
besides the Peninsular Mail steamers every week,
Gibraltar and the south of Spain would have no less than
six Mails per month, the Peninsular Mail Service might
be reduced to three times a month, or every ten days; for
which the Company were willing to make an abatement
of £9100 per annum from their contract-money for that
Service. These suggestions were adopted, effecting a
saving to the public of £16,000 to £17,000 per annum;
and, consequently, the monthly conveyance of the
Bombay branch of the India Mails between Southampton
and Alexandria was, by this arrangement,
obtained not only free of any additional expense to the
public, but with a financial benefit to it by an increase of
the postage revenue.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>DISCONTINUANCE OF THE ABOVE ARRANGEMENT.</h2>

<p>This arrangement was not remunerative to the Company,
inasmuch as the expense of the steam vessel, which,
in consequence of it, the Company were obliged to run
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
between Malta and Alexandria, was fully equal to the
whole amount of the sum received for the conveyance of
the Mails between Southampton and Alexandria, and it
also subjected the Company to some additional expenses
in carrying on their trade with Constantinople and the
Black Sea ports.</p>

<p>The Directors have on former occasions publicly stated
that they had, notwithstanding, no intention of breaking up
the arrangement, considering it as a link in the chain of
extensive postal communication, from which, as a whole,
the Company were deriving a large portion of their income.</p>

<p>The Government, however, thought proper to discontinue
it, on the alleged grounds of its being unnecessary,
and that a saving of expense to the public would be effected
thereby. The various memorials from Bombay, praying
in urgent terms for its re-establishment, form a sufficient
refutation of the first allegation. And the facts&mdash;that its
discontinuance necessitated the employment, by Government,
of an additional packet, to replace this Company’s
vessel, which carried the Mails between Malta and Alexandria,
at an expense exceeding the whole sum previously
paid to the Company&mdash;and that the breaking off of an
important branch of postal communication could not fail
to cause some diminution in the postage revenue&mdash;are
sufficient to show, that so far from the public being financially
benefited by the change, it has been accompanied
by a positive loss.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Termination and Renewal of the Contract of 1840,
for conveying the India and China Mails between
England and Alexandria.</i></p>

<p>The result of the recent proceedings of the Government,
in reference to this Contract, has been of a most satisfactory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
character, not only as regards the interests of this Company,
but the interests of other extensive enterprises
employed in the Contract Packet Service.</p>

<p>A summary of these proceedings will be found in the
evidence of Mr. T. C. Croker, in his answer to question
1306, wherein he read the following <i>précis</i> of them, furnished
by the Admiralty, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“On the 6th January, 1848, the Admiralty gave notice to the
Peninsular and Oriental Company, for the termination of the
contract, at the end of twelve months, on the 18th January,
1849. Their object in so doing was, to ascertain whether the
service could not be done at a cheaper rate. There had previously
been correspondence on the subject between the Admiralty,
the Treasury, and the Post-office; and the Treasury, by a
Minute, dated 4th February, and communicated on the 5th,
requested the Admiralty to give this notice. On the 27th of
March the Admiralty wrote to the Treasury, proposing that an
advertisement should be issued, calling for tenders for conveyance
of mails to and from Alexandria. On the 5th of April the
Treasury approved. The advertisement appeared in the <i>Gazette</i>
of the 21st of April. It was for the monthly conveyance of the
Calcutta and China Mails and despatches between England and
Alexandria, by way of Gibraltar and Malta, leaving England on
the 20th of each month. The contract was to commence on the
8th of January, 1849, and to last at least three years. On the
18th of May two tenders were received, one from the Peninsular
and Oriental Company, for the following sums: for the first year
of contract, £27,500; for the second, £27,000; for the third,
£26,500; for the fourth, £26,000; and so on, reducing £500
for each subsequent year that the contract remained in force, with
two vessels of 450-horse power, and a reserve vessel of 250-horse
power. Another tender was received from the India and
Australia Company for £25,650, offering the ‘Minerva,’ of
400-horse power, 627 tons; the ‘Admiral,’ of 400-horse
power, 929 tons; and one spare steam vessel, of 250-horse
power. The Peninsular and Oriental Company accompanied
their tender by a letter, in which, after stating the grounds upon
which they considered that the Government ought not to take
away the conveyance of the Mails from a Company which had
embarked so much capital in the undertaking, and had performed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
the service satisfactorily, they propose, that if the contract
is continued to them they will submit the accounts of all their
transactions connected with the mail service, from time to time, to
the inspection of such competent persons as the Government
may appoint; and that when the financial position of the
Company, with respect to such mail service, shall be such as,
after making the customary allowance for the repairs, wear and
tear, and sea risk of the vessels and property, a maximum
dividend of 10 per cent. can be realised, any surplus of earnings
over and above such maximum dividend shall be placed at the
disposal of the Treasury, for the benefit of the public. On the
19th of May the Admiralty wrote, that, previous to coming to a
decision upon the tender, they were anxious to ascertain whether
this proposal, if adopted, might be expected to cause any deduction,
and, if so, to what extent, from the account that would be
paid by the public if their tenders were accepted; they therefore
begged to be informed what surplus of profit beyond a dividend
of 10 per cent., after deductions for repairs, wear and tear, sea
risks of vessels and property, might be expected, from the calculations
the Company were able to make; and whether, in case a
satisfactory reply could not be given to this question, two officers
deputed by the Admiralty might at once have access to the
accounts, for information on that point, and previous to a decision
being come to on the tenders. This latter alternative was
at once adopted by the Directors of the Company, and they
opened all their accounts to the inspection of Captain Ellice and
Mr. Bond, who made a report on the subject, from which it
appeared that the Shareholders had never received a dividend of
10 per cent., and that the balance of receipts, after payment
of all expenses and charges, was not then sufficient for a dividend
of that amount; the Admiralty having ascertained that no
diminution of the tenders was likely to accrue from this proposal,
and, considering both tenders too high, declined them both. The
Admiralty then made an offer to the Peninsular and Oriental
Company, founded on the mileage rate, viz., 4s. 6d. paid to
them for the Lisbon and Gibraltar Line. This was not accepted&mdash;but
after several interviews with the Directors of the Company,
it was signified to the Admiralty that they would be willing to
undertake the service for £24,000 a year, diminishing annually
by £500, until the expiration of the contract, which was not in
any case to cease before the 1st of January, 1853. The India and
Australia Company also made an offer, which was, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
not admissible, for it required a fourteen years’ contract; it was
for a mileage of 5s. 6d. a mile for the first seven years, and at
4s. 6d. a mile for the remaining seven years. They afterwards
modified the offer as to the duration of the contract; and the
Government, finding that there were competing offers before
them, determined upon affording another opportunity for public
competition; and on the 2nd of November, 1848, tenders were
again sent in, in accordance with a public advertisement, from the
same parties. The tender of the Peninsular and Oriental Company
was higher than their offer made in pursuance of private
negotiation, though the terms were the same. It was for
£26,750, with a diminution of £500 after the first four years,
in the event of its being continued, and £1,000 additional a year,
if the port of embarkation were removed to Plymouth. The India
and Australia Company tendered for £18,450, in two vessels of
400-horse power, and one reserve of 150-horse power; the same
vessel being mentioned in both tenders, as in the former one.
The lowest tender was directed by the Treasury to be accepted,
provided they could furnish satisfactory security for the due performance
of the service they were to undertake. Much inquiry
and negotiation then took place, and the Company were allowed
until the sailing of the last packet provided for under the
expiring contract, to prove that they had capital sufficient for the
undertaking,&mdash;but they failed in showing that they possessed
sufficient paid-up capital, and they did not actually possess the
vessels mentioned in their tender, so that on the 20th December,
the Board of Admiralty closed that negotiation, and having
obtained the consent of the Peninsular and Oriental Company to
renew their former offer of £24,000, recommended it for the
sanction of the Treasury, and it was adopted in the existing
contract.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The result of this transaction has, there is every reason
to believe, satisfied the Government of the correctness of
the opinions which were pressed upon its attention, on
behalf of this Company, in the course of the proceedings
above detailed, namely:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That fully recognising, as one of the first duties of
a Government, the protection of the public interests, by
economising the public resources, the mode adopted for
doing so, by closing at short periods and re-opening to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
public tender these large Contracts for the Mail Service,
is neither effective for benefiting the public, nor altogether
equitable as regards the interests of those private parties
who had embarked capital in the formation of the extensive
steam navigation enterprises, by means of which these important
postal communications were first established.</p>

<p>2. Because experience has amply proved, that capitalists
cannot be induced to embark their money in any extensive
steam navigation enterprise, intended to compete with
one previously established.</p>

<p>3. Because the very act of terminating these Contracts
at short periods, and then putting them up to public
competition, increases the difficulty of obtaining <i>bonâ
fide</i> competitors, inasmuch as no capitalist of ordinary
prudence will embark in an enterprise dependent for its
success upon its employment in a public service of so
uncertain or transient a duration.</p>

<p>4. Because, were it even possible to create a competing
Company on so extensive a scale as would be required to
perform efficiently the Contract Mail Services alluded to,
the two Companies would either, one or both of them, be
ruined&mdash;or, what is much more probable, for the protection
of their mutual interests would coalesce, and thus
establish a stronger monopoly than could ever be effected
by a single Company.</p>

<p>5. Because it is but just that parties who have embarked
so large an amount of capital in the establishment
of such enterprises, and who have thereby, as has already
been shown, been the means of effecting important public
benefits, should have a preference of employment,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> so
long as they perform the public service efficiently, and
are willing to do so on terms realising to them no more
than a fair commercial profit.</p>

<p>6. That there is no practical difficulty in protecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
the public interest, without opening these Contracts to
public tender, by either of the following means:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, By stipulating for a diminishing scale of payments,
on the plan adopted by this Company in their Contract
for the Southampton and Alexandria Mail Service. The
public, by this plan, derive a benefit from any increase of
income which, by the progressive development of their
enterprise, the Contractors may obtain from the increase
of commercial traffic.</p>

<p>Secondly, By stipulating that, at intervening periods of
the Contract, the question of reduction should be submitted
to two competent arbitrators, one to be appointed by the
Government, who should investigate the Contractor’s
transactions, and make an award as to whether any and
what reduction ought to be made in the payment for the
Mail Services.</p>

<p>The Committee of the House of Commons seem to
have recognised the eligibility of the principle of the last
mode of proceeding, in the third and concluding resolution
of their Report, namely&mdash;“They suggest that if it
be decided to renew the existing Contracts, the most
strict and searching inquiry should be instituted, by some
responsible department of the Government, into the cost
of the execution, into the manner in which the Service
has been performed, and into the profits resulting from
the several transactions to the Companies by which they
have been respectively carried on.”</p>

<p>This suggestion, it has been shown, was anticipated by
the Directors of the Peninsular and Oriental Company,
in offering their books and accounts to the inspection of
Government.

<h3><i>Efficiency of Performance of the Mail Service.</i></h3>

<p>Extract from Mr. T. C. Croker of the Admiralty’s
evidence.</p>

<p>1115. Has the contract been well performed?&mdash;I can speak from
a knowledge of nine years to the manner in which that contract
has been performed, and it has been performed most admirably,
and has given general satisfaction; in fact, the only fault which
has been found with the manner in which it has been performed
is, that it has been done too well.</p>

<p>1116. Will you explain what you mean by being done too
well?&mdash;The vessels arrived sooner than it was calculated they
should have done, which was made matter of public complaint.</p>

<p>1176. At our last meeting we had brought your examination
down to the period at which the alteration took place in the arrangements
between the Peninsular Company and the Government?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>1177. The Committee then understood from you that up to that
period the contract had been carried on, as far as you were aware,
in a satisfactory manner?&mdash;Highly so; here are the testimonials
of the Admiralty as to the satisfactory manner in which the
contract was carried on.</p>

<p>1606. With reference to the Indian part of it, is it within your
knowledge how far that contract has been performed?&mdash;It has
been well performed.</p>

<p>1607. Throughout?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<h3><i>No Breaches of Contract committed.</i></h3>

<p>Mr. Croker further examined&mdash;</p>

<p>1152. Would not the Admiralty agent on board those packets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
be cognizant of any breach of contract which had occurred?&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<p>1153. Do not they make reports to the Admiralty through the
officers conducting the packet service at Southampton?&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<p>1154. Would not any breach of contract come immediately
to the knowledge of the Admiralty, through the report of the
Admiralty agent?&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<p>1155. Therefore the absence of any such report is direct proof
that the contract has not been broken, provided the Admiralty
agent does his duty?&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<h4><i>Complaints made to the Admiralty against the Company.</i></h4>

<p>1974. At your last examination you carried down a statement of
any complaints, or in the absence of any complaints, to a certain
date, with respect to the performance of the contracts of which
we were then inquiring, of the vessels of the Oriental Company;
have you furnished yourself since with any further particulars
upon that subject?&mdash;This is a <i>précis</i> of the correspondence
respecting complaints of the manner in which the contract mail
service in the Indian and China Seas has been performed.</p>

<p>1975. At what date does that <i>précis</i> commence?&mdash;The 23rd of
August, 1846.</p>

<p>1976. Does that <i>précis</i> come down to the present time?&mdash;It
does.</p>

<p>1977. Who is responsible for that being a correct statement of
what has taken place?&mdash;Mr. Worth, the head of the packet
department.</p>

<p>1978. Have you sufficiently examined that <i>précis</i> to be able to
give to the Committee a statement of the number of complaints
which are contained in it?&mdash;I should say there were three or four
complaints; I have read it through.</p>

<p>1979. Were any of those complaints on examination found to be
just?&mdash;I think the last complaint is at present undergoing
investigation.</p>

<p>1980. What is the date of the last complaint?&mdash;October, 1848.</p>

<p>1981. Will you state the general grounds of the complaints; were
the complaints of the state of accommodation and the conduct of
the officers on board, or of the time that the vessels occupied
upon the voyage, whether beyond the limited time or not?&mdash;The
first complaint states that “Lady Mary Wood” was much
out of repair.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>1982. What is the date of that?&mdash;The 23rd of August, 1846.</p>

<p>1983. From whom is that complaint?&mdash;Captain Ellice, the
superintendent of the packet service at Southampton.</p>

<p>1984. He is a Government officer?&mdash;Yes; the complaint was
that in consequence she exceeded the contract time by nineteen
hours.</p>

<p>1985. By nineteen hours on the whole voyage, or between
England and Suez?&mdash;The statement is, that in her last voyage
from Hong Kong to Ceylon she exceeded the contract time by
nineteen hours.</p>

<p>1986. How is it that the Government agent at Southampton
makes a report of the state of a vessel in the Indian Seas; did he
transmit a complaint from somebody else?&mdash;He transmitted a
letter from the Admiralty agent on board.</p>

<p>1987. What was the result of that complaint?&mdash;“The contractor
was acquainted that the Board of Admiralty had been
informed that the ‘Lady Mary Wood’ was getting exceedingly
out of repair, and requested to be informed when a vessel, such as
is required by the contract, will be substituted for her. The contractors
stated in reply that the information furnished to the
Admiralty was exaggerated; this vessel had no defects but what
could be made good on her return to Hong Kong, defects mostly
caused by the severity of the passage from that port to Point de
Galle; and they inclosed a copy of the carpenter’s report, and
extract of the commander’s letter. They further stated, that (as
the Admiralty is, no doubt, aware) in consequence of the recent
demand in engineering and shipwright work, the builders have
not possibly been able to fulfil their contracts in point of time;
and the result is, that of six steam ships of 450-horse power
building for them, not one is yet completed, though contracted
to be delivered within the last year. They fully expect to be
able to despatch one of those vessels in substitution of the
‘Lady Mary Wood,’ in November next, and a second of the
same class and power about three months after, in substitution
of the ‘Braganza.’”</p>

<p>1988. What is the date of that letter?&mdash;The 28th of August.</p>

<p>1989. What is the date of the complaint?&mdash;The 23rd of
August.</p>

<p>1990. What is the date of the complaint transmitted?&mdash;That
does not appear from the <i>précis</i>. The Admiralty agent employed
on the voyage from Hong Kong to Ceylon writes this complaint,
which reaches Captain Ellice about the 23rd August, 1846.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>1991. What would be the ordinary length of communication
between Ceylon and Southampton?&mdash;That is arranged by the
contract; as I have had very little to do with the contracts in the
Indian Seas, I am not prepared to say.</p>

<p>1992. Is it not about five months?<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>1993. Taking it at five months preceding this date of the complaint,
they say that another vessel will be ready by November of
the same year?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>1994. What was the result of the complaint as to the want of
punctuality in the time?&mdash;The contractors were acquainted, on
the 23rd of August, with this complaint, and what I have read
is their explanation.</p>

<p>1995. The explanation which you have read is with reference to
the non-repair of the vessel, it is not with reference to the time
at all. Is there any letter from the Admiralty, either admitting
the excuse to be satisfactory or otherwise?&mdash;The Admiralty
seem to have admitted the excuse, for they minute the letter,
acknowledging the receipt of it.</p>

<p>1996. Did the Admiralty officer on board the ship report anything
respecting the improper state of the ship before leaving
Hong Kong?&mdash;He stated that the “Lady Mary Wood” was
much out of repair in her last voyage from Hong Kong to Ceylon.</p>

<p>1997. It was after his arrival in Ceylon that he made that
report?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>1998. But he does not appear to have made any statement of
that sort previous to the commencement of the voyage from Hong
Kong?&mdash;There is nothing in the <i>précis</i> to show that he did.</p>

<p>1999. What is the next complaint?&mdash;“On the 28th of September
of the same year, Captain Ellice sent a copy of a letter from
the Admiralty agent on board the ‘Lady Mary Wood,’ reporting
that vessel having grounded on a bank of sand or mud off the
town of Penang, and reporting the deficiency of night-signals on
board her; and he states that the vessel was got off on the
following day, in a fit state to proceed with the mails, and, it was
supposed, would proceed with the mails to China.”</p>

<p>2000. What is the next complaint?&mdash;The next complaint is
transmitted by Captain Ellice, who sends a report of the survey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
on the “Braganza,” held at Hong Kong; he sent this on the
21st of June, 1847.</p>

<p>2001. What is the result of the survey?&mdash;“A copy was sent to
the contractors, and the contractors stated, in reply, that they had
transmitted orders, some time ago, to their agent at Bombay, to
have this vessel docked on the first opportunity, and had reason
to believe that this had been done. They also stated that their
new steamships ‘Pekin,’ of 1,200 tons and 430-horse power,
and ‘Pottinger,’ of 1,400 tons and 450-horse power, are now
stationed on the line between Point de Galle and China, in performance
of the mail contract service.”</p>

<p>2002. What is the next complaint?&mdash;“On the 2nd of October,
Captain Ellice transmitted an extract of a letter from the
Admiralty agent on board the ‘Pekin,’ reporting the unfitness
of that vessel for the mail service.” This forms a part of
Lieutenant Waghorn’s complaint, and is already before the
Committee.</p>

<p>2003. What was the result of that; was the complaint decided
to be well-founded or not?&mdash;I think not.</p>

<p>2004. Was Lieutenant Waghorn a passenger on board that
vessel?&mdash;I put in his letter on the last occasion.</p>

<p>2005. Will you proceed to the next complaint?&mdash;“On the 2nd
of June, 1848, the Postmaster-general transmitted an extract of a
letter from the post-office agent at Suez, stating that the ‘Haddington’
was detained at that port, waiting for the arrival of
cargo, until one o’clock <small>A.M.</small> on the 11th ultimo, although the
mails were put on board at ten minutes past five o’clock on the
previous morning; and, further, that some of the packages
forming the cargo were of an unnecessarily cumbersome size.”</p>

<p>2006. What was the result of that?&mdash;The contractors were
called upon to state whether they can account for this delay; and
in reply they state that they are not aware of this delay, but will
call upon the agent at Suez for explanation; that the mails being
transmitted by land from Alexandria to Suez, there is seldom
any variation in the time of their transit, whilst the passengers
and baggage, at the period of low Nile (May and June), are
frequently retarded in getting the steamers round the bends of
the river; and they apprehend that the Admiralty must have
been misinformed as to the size of the packages, the weight of
which are, by their regulation, limited to under 100 lbs., four of
such packages forming a camel load for the desert passage.</p>

<p>2007. Is there any thing further upon that complaint, because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
the Company seem to doubt the fact?&mdash;Nothing further appears
upon the subject of the complaint.</p>

<p>2008. Is there any subsequent report from the Company?&mdash;No
subsequent report from the Company appears to have been
received.</p>

<p>2009. Is there any subsequent complaint?&mdash;“On the 3rd of
October, 1848, another complaint is made: The Indian and
Australian Mail Steam Packet Company complain that the
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Packet Company do not employ
steam vessels of the size required by the contract, between Suez
and Calcutta, and between Ceylon and Hong Kong, and offer to
do the service at less expense.”</p>

<p>2010. What is the result of that?&mdash;“They were acquainted that
they had omitted to state in what particulars they considered the
contract with this Company is now infringed, that the Admiralty
were not aware that any requirements of that contract are not
now observed, excepting that the ‘Haddington,’ temporarily
employed in the place of another vessel, is 442-horse power
instead of 500-horse power.”</p>

<p>2011. Have you any other complaint?&mdash;There is no other complaint,
but there is another communication from the Indian and
Australian Steam Packet Company. They “enter into further
explanation and remarks, and hope the contract with the
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Packet Companies may be forthwith
dissolved.” That is marked as “read.”</p>

<p>2012. With reference to the complaint to which your attention
was called the last time you were examined, from Admiral Collier,
what is the result of that?&mdash;I have here a paper endorsed,
“Complaint of irregularities in the performance of the East
India and China contract, in the case of the ‘Achilles.’”</p>

<p>2013. Is that the complaint referred to by Admiral Collier?&mdash;It
is.</p>

<p>2014. Was there a letter or memorial of the merchants of Hong
Kong transmitted by Admiral Collier to the Admiralty?&mdash;There
was.</p>

<p>2015. What was the subject of that memorial or letter?&mdash;The
merchants represented to Sir Francis Collier the serious inconvenience
which they, “and, in particular, the Canton community,
have suffered, and continue to suffer, by the frequent late arrival
of the steamers conveying her Majesty’s mails. The delay seems
to have arisen from the steamers being generally unable to keep
the time contracted for by the Admiralty, for the performance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
the several distances, as will be seen, we believe, by the reports
sent home by the Admiralty agents, appointed to the several
steamers. The time slowed is very ample, rendering it seldom
necessary to exceed a speed of eight miles per hour; and had the
steamers been the superior class of vessels contracted for by the
Admiralty, and ‘keeping pace with the advanced state of
science,’ no difficulty in performing the passages within the
specified time ought ever to be experienced. An improvement
has lately taken place in the class of boats, by the arrival of
other steamers; but the system adopted, and particularly, of
late, of overloading them, and to such an extent as to render it
necessary to carry a large quantity of coal on deck, tends to perpetrate
the evil, and to create even greater detention than before,
while it greatly endangers the lives of her Majesty’s subjects,
and the safety of her Majesty’s mails. It is our opinion, that
on several occasions it may solely be attributed to unforeseen
and fortunate circumstances that the steamers have been enabled
to reach their destination. Considering the large sum given by
her Majesty’s Government for the purpose of carrying the
mails, and also that thereby the Peninsular and Oriental Company
are enabled to have a monopoly of the traffic on this side
of Egypt, we think the mercantile community have reason to
expect that, at all events, the contract shall be faithfully adhered
to, and that the steamers shall not be allowed to carry beyond a
certain and safe amount of cargo;” and they request Sir Francis
Collier to call the attention of the Lords of the Admiralty to the
subject.</p>

<p>2016. Was that transmitted by Admiral Collier?&mdash;It was transmitted
to the Admiralty by Admiral Collier.</p>

<p>2017. What was Sir Francis Collier’s remark or observation
when he transmitted that memorial?&mdash;Sir Francis Collier’s letter
does not appear to be in this correspondence, but I presume it
can be produced.</p>

<p>2018. What was done in consequence of the transmission of that
memorial?&mdash;“A letter appears to have been written on the 11th
of April, 1849, by the Secretary of the Admiralty to the
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, enclosing a
copy of the memorial which had been received from Sir Francis
Collier, and the Company were acquainted that the Board of
Admiralty trusted that they had already taken steps to prevent
the recurrence of the delays complained of.”</p>

<p>2019. Will you read any previous letter on the same subject
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
which was laid before the Admiralty by the Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Packet Company?&mdash;“Admiralty, 6th March,
1849.” (This is from the Secretary of the Admiralty to the
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Packet Company.) “Gentlemen,
it having been represented to my Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty that the contract steam packet, ‘Achilles,’ was
delayed in her voyage from Point de Galle to Hong Kong, in
November last, she having sailed from the former place on the
29th of that month, and not arriving at Hong Kong until the
23rd of December; thus being 175 hours beyond the time
allowed by the contract; I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty to call your attention to the circumstance,
and to acquaint you that it appears that the place
intended for coals on board the ‘Achilles’ was occupied by
opium chests, and the coals placed on deck, and the vessel
overloaded; and that my Lords are informed that her arrival at
Hong Kong, 175 hours after she was due, was owing to the
excess of cargo, and to the negligent and lazy manner in which
the vessel was coaled at Singapore.”</p>

<p>2020. What was the result of that letter?&mdash;The secretary of the
Company answered it on the 10th of March, 1849&mdash;“I have the
honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated 6th
instant, calling the attention of the Directors of the Company to
a representation which has been made to the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, that the Company’s contract steamer,
‘Achilles,’ was considerably delayed upon her voyage from
Point de Galle to Hong Kong, in November last, and that such
delay was owing to the excess of cargo, and to negligence in the
coaling at Singapore. In reply, I am instructed to express the
great regret with which the Directors have received this communication,
and to acquaint you, for the information of their
Lordships, that a rumour having already reached them that
some representations of the kind had been addressed to their
Lordships, the Directors, by the mail of the 24th of February,
wrote to the Company’s superintendent at Bombay, calling upon
him for full and immediate explanation of the circumstances.
Until the receipt of his report it will be impossible for the
Directors to say how far the allegations in question are well
founded; but, in the meantime, they are anxious to state that
their standing instructions to all the agents and officers of the
Company are, that the punctual performance of the mail service
is to be ever regarded by them as paramount to every other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
consideration, and that any departure from that principle will
be visited by the Directors with the utmost severity. The
Directors take this opportunity of acquainting you, for the information
of their Lordships, that having found by experience that
no commercial house, however high its respectability, can represent
the Company so efficiently at foreign stations as an officer of
their own, they, by the last steamer, despatched Captain Sparkes,
lately the Company’s superintendent at Southampton, to relieve
the firm at present acting as the Company’s agents at Singapore,
in the superintendence of the Company’s affairs at that port,
and they feel every confidence that he will actively and zealously
discharge his duties at that station. The Directors also think it
right to state, that from such information as they are at present
in possession of, they have reason to consider that the representation
which has been made to their Lordships is exaggerated,
both as regards the extent of the delay of the ‘Achilles,’ and
the alleged causes thereof.”</p>

<p>2021. This letter is of the date of the 10th of March, 1849; what
is the date of the memorial of the merchants of Canton?&mdash;The
29th of December, 1848.</p>

<p>2022. Was there any corresponding complaint or representation
from the Admiralty officer on board the vessel to the Lords of
the Admiralty?&mdash;I cannot state.</p>

<p>2023. Was not the first letter which you read in consequence of
the official representations made to the Admiralty, through their
officer, as to the delay of the “Achilles,” previous to the reception
of the memorial from Hong Kong?&mdash;I have no doubt
it was.</p>

<p>2024. The Company say, in the letter of the 10th of March, that
they can give no answer to the complaint made of misfeasance in
the contract between Ceylon and China, til they shall receive a
report from their agent at Bombay?&mdash;They state that they
wrote to their superintendent at Bombay, calling upon him for
an immediate explanation of the circumstances.</p>

<p>2025. Do you know that the service is now performed from
Ceylon to China by a vessel that starts from Bombay, and picks
up the mail there?&mdash;I believe it is so.</p>

<p>2026. What was the result of those communications; did the
Admiralty come to any decision upon them?&mdash;On the 12th of
March, the Admiralty acquainted the Company that they
“were gratified to learn that they had despatched an officer of
their own to act as superintendent at Singapore, and who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
may be able to prevent the recurrence of the delay complained
of.”</p>

<p>2027. Nothing was done by the Admiralty but to express their
satisfaction that the Company had sent out an agent to
Singapore, as an answer to that complaint of the Company
overloading their vessels, and being out of time?&mdash;The Admiralty
subsequently sent forward the letter I have read from the merchants,
stating, “that their Lordships trust you have already
taken steps to prevent the recurrence of the delays complained
of.” The Admiralty appear to have done nothing more; the
matter is still in the course of investigation; it is not yet
closed; the explanation has not yet been received from the
Company.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>2028. Have you any other complaints?&mdash;No.</p>

<h4><i>Charge of corrupt Jobbing, and Favouritism by the Admiralty
towards the Peninsular and Oriental Company.</i></h4>

<p>Examination of Mr. Andrew Henderson&mdash;</p>

<p>2138. Am I to understand that you make two complaints:
first, that there was no opportunity for tendering; and, secondly,
that the price was too high?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2139. Were you during the period, from the beginning, in
1844, to the time at which the contract was finally signed, in
constant communication with the Admiralty?&mdash;I used to go
to the Contract Packet Office, which was the only place I could
go to; I could get no answer to my letter.</p>

<p>2140. Did it come before the Board?&mdash;It appears not; Mr.
Sidney Herbert told me that he had never heard of it.</p>

<p>2141. On the 8th of August Mr. Sidney Herbert told you it
was open to you to send in any contract that you wished?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2142. Did you send in a contract, offering to do the service
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
with efficient vessels for £60,000?&mdash;No; I gave this proof that
it could be done; but I made no tender for it, because I had no
vessel for it.</p>

<p>2143. Your opinion was, that £60,000 was an adequate price,
and that the public in general, and you in particular, ought to
have an opportunity of making a tender; did you tender to do the
service at that price?&mdash;In reply to that question I may state, that
early in December the representative of the “Precursor,” Sir
George Larpent, and myself, waited upon the President of the
Board of Control, and asked him to take care that our interests
should be considered, and we received an assurance that they
should be considered; and in the scheme for the mails it is
particularly stated that those two vessels were ready, and it was
suggested that they should take alternately the mails with the
other two vessels.</p>

<p>2144. I ask you whether you did or did not offer to do the
service for £60,000?&mdash;I can hardly say whether you can call it
an offer, but I submitted a scheme by which it was shown that it
could be done for £60,000; contracts were not advertised for,
and therefore we were not in a position to send in contracts.</p>

<p>2145. You placed in the hands of Mr. Crofton Croker a lithographic
statement, from which you considered the inference might
be drawn that £60,000 would be sufficient for that service?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2146. Was that statement anonymous, or was it guaranteed by
any name?&mdash;It was guaranteed by my own name; and the same
thing was stated in the plan submitted to Government; and that
plan has, every bit of it, been carried out since.</p>

<p>2147. My only object is to come to an accurate understanding
of the facts; I understand your grievance to be, that the more
expensive tender, from the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Packet
Company, was accepted by the Admiralty, when a cheaper
contract might have been had from other parties, and that, in
your judgment, £60,000 a year would have been ample for that
service; is that so?&mdash;My complaint is, that the proposal of the
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Packet Company to undertake
the Bombay mails was not accepted, but that they were allowed
to adopt all my plans, and I was refused all participation in it.
It could not be called a contract, it was not the time for a
contract; contracts were never asked for; but there was clear
evidence given that, if we were allowed to take it, it could be
done for £60,000.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>2148. You complain that an unfair advantage was allowed to
be taken of you, by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Packet
Company?&mdash;Certainly; I complain that they were allowed to
take advantage of my plans and to adopt them, and that I was
not allowed to compete for the contract.</p>

<p>2149. In your plan, you said it could be done for £60,000?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2150. Your general plan has been adopted by the Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Packet Company?&mdash;Yes; my plan was distinctly
opposed to theirs. Their plan was this: the vessels which were
bound to go every month to Bengal, they purposed that those
vessels should go to Bombay, and that once in every two months
those vessels should go to Calcutta. That was, in point of fact,
reducing the present communication, from a separate mail to
Bombay and Calcutta, to one mail to Bombay.</p>

<p>2151. Your complaint was, that you were excluded from the
opportunity of competing for the contract?&mdash;Yes; and that my
plans were adopted.</p>

<p>2152. You have put it on record, that on the 6th of August
the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated to you, that he had given
no authority for the conclusion of the contract?&mdash;Yes, he said
that he had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>2153. On the 8th of August, two days afterwards, you have
put it on record that the Secretary to the Admiralty told you
that it was quite open to you to send in any tender you pleased?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2154. And it was therefore open to the public in general, and
to you in particular, to put in a tender thereupon?&mdash;I sent in a
distinct tender for the China mail.</p>

<p>2155. But we were speaking of the service for which you say
£60,000 was ample; viz. the Suez and Calcutta service. Confining
yourself at present to that, you were told by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, on the 6th of August, that the contract was
not concluded, and you were told by the Secretary of the
Admiralty, on the 8th of August, that it was open to you, in
particular, to send in any tender for the conveyance of the mail
from Suez to Calcutta?&mdash;I was engaged in the other one at the
time.</p>

<p>2156. Then is there any grievance at all as regards your being
deprived of the mail from Suez to Calcutta?&mdash;Certainly, a very
great grievance.</p>

<p>2157. Be as good as to explain what that grievance is?&mdash;The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
grievance is, that the “India” and the “Precursor” were not
allowed to participate in the advantage.</p>

<p>2158. Then, whether the sum paid for the service was £60,000
or £170,000, your grievance is, that the “India” and the
“Precursor” did not come in for a share of it?&mdash;That is one point;
but, on public grounds, I maintain that the sum given was a great
deal too large, and that that sum was not given to merchants
and shipowners in India, but to a London company.</p>

<p>2159. To whomever it was given, £60,000 would have been
the sum for which shipowners would have been ready to do
the service?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2160. You had a knowledge of the fact, at the time the tender
was open to you, that it could be done for £60,000?&mdash;I had not
money enough to do it.</p>

<p>2161. Were you not in communication with all the principal
shipowners who signed the petition?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2162. Did you get up the petition which was presented on the
8th of August?&mdash;I did.</p>

<p>2163. Are those parties whose names were signed to it parties
who had capital to compete for a good contract, if it was to be
had?&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<p>2164. Did they, or any of them, send in a tender to the Board
of Admiralty to do this service for £60,000?&mdash;No; they stated
their belief that it was of no use to send in a tender, as it would
not be attended to; that the contract would be sure to be given
to the Peninsular and Oriental Company, whatever they chose
to ask.</p>

<p>2165. Did you tell Mr. Green, and all the other parties who
signed the petition, that Mr. Sidney Herbert had told you that it
was open to you to send in a tender?&mdash;My impression is that it
was known to them, but Mr. Green said, “No, let them alone;
they are too strong for us.”</p>

<p>2166. Then it was known to Mr. Green, and all the other
parties who petitioned, that they had an opportunity to make a
tender?&mdash;The expression they used was, that it was taken out of
their hands, and that it was of no use their doing it; but I do
not know that I saw Mr. Green after that time.</p>

<p>2167. Do you mean to represent that the principal shipowners
having information that the Secretary of the Admiralty had stated
that the contract was open, were nevertheless of opinion, that if
they offered to do the service for £60,000, the Board of Admiralty
would still give the contract to a party who required a much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
larger sum?&mdash;I hardly know how to answer that question. I
cannot say that I saw Mr. Green after the petition, but his
impression was that it was of no use to compete with that
powerful Company.</p>

<p>2168. Do you mean to represent to the Committee your opinion
that while the Board of Admiralty told you that you might
compete if you pleased, they had in point of fact made up their
minds to give the contract to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Packet Company at a much higher price?&mdash;That was our firm
belief, that they had made up their minds to give it to them.
This I know as a fact, that when the matter was handed over
from the East India Company, and the East India Company
had nothing to do with it, the Peninsular and Oriental Company
asked £170,000, and they had it all their own way; but the
East India Company said that they would not pay more than a
certain amount annually; they were to pay a certain proportion,
but they said, “We will do nothing of the kind; you may do as
you like: we will have nothing to do with it beyond paying
a certain amount.”</p>

<p>2169. Did it occur to you that if so scandalous a spirit of jobbing
as you describe had actuated the Board of Admiralty, you might
have put them completely in the wrong by offering a contract
from parties competent to perform the service for £60,000,
which you laid down as the proper sum?&mdash;I can answer the
question in this way: it is all very well to say, “Why did you
not send in a contract?” but it is a contract that required a large
capital and great arrangements. It is impossible to make all
those great arrangements in two days; the Peninsular Company,
by obtaining under false pretences £20,000 for the Calcutta
mail, had put all other parties out; and if you say, “Will you
make a contract in a couple of days now for £60,000?” it is impossible;
it requires a large fleet and great capital. Mr. Green
has a large fleet, but they are employed in other parts; and his
expression was, “It is of no use competing with the Peninsular
Company, for they are too powerful for us; their influence is so
great.”</p>

<p>2170. You mean to represent that all the shipowners in London
acquiesced in the opinion that public money to a large amount
was going to be given from favouritism to the Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Packet Company; but that it was of no use, on
account of the secret influence which the Peninsular and Oriental
Steam Packet Company had got at the Admiralty, to contend with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
them?&mdash;That was my own individual belief, and the petitioners,
I think, agreed in that.</p>

<p>2171. Did you lend a large share in the drawing up of this
petition?&mdash;I did.</p>

<p>2172. Is it your composition?&mdash;I do not know that it is.</p>

<p>2173. In the petition you object not to one contract in particular,
but to the system of contracts altogether?&mdash;We object not to the
whole system of contracts, but to the system under which it has
been carried on; in the first place, there are put into the contracts
conditions which are never acted upon; that I consider extremely
wrong; it keeps all honest men away.</p>

<p>2174. The stringent conditions put into the contracts keep all
honest men away?&mdash;That is going too far; I mean to say that you
are asked to agree to very strict conditions, which a man cannot
honestly say, “I agree to.” If the condition says that if I am
half an hour behind time I shall forfeit £500, a man naturally
asks himself, “Shall I enter into the contract? for if those clauses
are inserted, I am a ruined man, and therefore I cannot guarantee
that.”</p>

<p>2175. If you and your friends had tendered this service for
£60,000, you would have required more reasonable conditions?&mdash;I
should have no objection to being bound to all reasonable conditions.
The late contract for the mail to the Brazils is as it
ought to be; there is no kind of trap of so many hours; the
condition is simply this, the ships are to be efficient vessels.</p>

<p>2176. No honest man, in your opinion, would have undertaken
such a contract as that which the Peninsular and Oriental Company
undertook, for £60,000?&mdash;What I mean is this, that no honest
man would undertake a thing which he was not competent to
perform; for instance, he would not undertake that the passage
shall be a certain number of hours; and putting in those strict
conditions would prevent an honest man from taking part in it.</p>

<p>2177. I understood you to say, that no honest man would undertake,
and therefore I presume you would not have recommended
anybody to undertake, so strict a condition as that of which we
are speaking?&mdash;I am afraid you are putting a wrong construction
upon what I said; I say, no honest man would undertake a condition
which he could not honestly say he could perform. If I
bound myself to go in a certain number of hours between certain
points, an honest man would say, if that was a great speed, “I
cannot bind myself to accomplish that.”</p>

<p>2178. That would prevent an honest man from complying with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
the conditions imposed upon the Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Packet Company?&mdash;That is putting it in the other way; I am
certain that I would have taken the contract, because I know that
Government would not exact the penalty.</p>

<p>2179. You would have taken it, though an honest man would not
have taken it?&mdash;I am afraid you are misinterpreting me; you
use the words “honest man” in a different sense from that in
which I use them. I mean to say that an honest man could not
honestly undertake to do a thing which was almost impracticable;
but, as I know the Government would not have exacted the
penalty, I would have taken the contract if I had had an opportunity;
but I had no opportunity.</p>

<p>2180. You would have taken the contract?&mdash;Yes, anybody would
take the contract for £170,000 a year; nobody would have
refused it.</p>

<p>2181. You were under the impression that the Peninsular and
Oriental Company were so strong that nobody could compete
with them?&mdash;Yes, and that is the impression now.</p>

<p>2182. That was your impression at the time you lent your aid
to the drawing up of that petition?&mdash;Yes, it was.</p>

<p>2183. It was the impression, you believe, of the parties who
signed the petition?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2184. Is that, in point of fact, one of the allegations of the
petition?&mdash;I do not know.</p>

<p>2185. Are not the allegations of the petition totally of a different
effect; are they not against contracts in general?&mdash;Certainly not
against contracts in general; they are against contracts being
given without fair competition; they are not against contracts
generally, for contracts must be had somehow, but they should
be fair and open.</p>

<p>2186. The prayer of the petition is “that public money granted
for the purposes of steam navigation shall be applied, not for the
exclusive advantage of any companies or individuals, but so that
all engaged in shipping may fairly participate therein, or equally
compete; therefore affording to your petitioners the opportunity
of showing to your Honourable House the truth (if doubted) as
to facts and principles of all the statements of this their humble
petition.” If you were under the impression that the Admiralty
were actuated by so corrupt a spirit that it was not of any use for
solvent parties to send in tenders, will you explain to the Committee
why it was that you left that out, as one of the allegations
of the petition which you drew up at the time?&mdash;I do not understand
the question.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>2187. Your grievance was, that you were shut out from fair
competition by a corrupt predetermination at the Admiralty to
exclude you, and to give the contract, at all hazards, to the other
Company?&mdash;In answer to that, I state the fact that I was not
allowed to compete with them in any way.</p>

<p>2188. You have told me that you did not send in a tender to the
Admiralty, and that you prepared a petition which you presented
to Parliament; that petition contains no allegation of such a
corrupt predetermination on the part of the Admiralty; having,
therefore, such a feeling in your mind at the time, you neither
put it to the test by sending in a tender to the Admiralty, nor
did you venture to state that in the petition to the House of
Commons?&mdash;The petition will speak for itself; it is there.</p>

<p>2189. There is no such allegation in the petition. What information
has come to your knowledge, since you petitioned Parliament,
which justifies you now in making such an improbable statement
here, viz., that there was that corrupt predetermination at the
Board of Admiralty?&mdash;I did not use the word “corrupt.”</p>

<p>2190. Have you learnt anything since you presented the petition,
which justifies you in making a charge now, which you would not
have been equally justified in making then: it appears that the
petition presented on the 8th August, 1844, contains no such
charge of favouritism against the Board of Admiralty; what
information have you received since that time, which you think
justifies you in making the charge now?&mdash;I think it is self*-evident
that there most have been favouritism, or the public
would have been admitted, and also from the way in which the
contract has been carried out. The Peninsular Company have
several times broken their contract, and no penalties have been
exacted. There was one distinct case of favouritism, which was
this: one of the reasons assigned to me why the China contract
was given to them was, that the Peninsular and Oriental Company
had offered to do it with vessels of 400-horse power for £45,000
a year; apparently at the same price as our tender. but ours was
to be reduced the third year, and theirs was to continue at the
same rate; but their condition was, that they were to find vessels,
from the 1st July, 1846, of 400-horse power, and they failed to
do so; and in consequence of their not providing those vessels,
the vessels were overworked, and the mails were delayed; but yet
the penalty has not been exacted, and that arises from favouritism.</p>

<p>2191. Is your impression that it is one part of the duty
of the Admiralty to take care that the parties tendering are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
in the possession of efficient vessels, and are men of sufficient
property and respectability to afford a security that the contract
will be performed?&mdash;My opinion is, that a contract of that kind
is a matter which ought not to be left to the Admiralty; it is a
matter more concerning the Board of Trade than the Admiralty;
and it is all a mistake for one department of the Board of Admiralty
to have the management of it.</p>

<p>2192. Be so good as to inform me whether you think the Government,
in making a contract, are bound to foresee, as far as
may be possible, whether the parties will really be able to fulfil it.
You have stated that the Peninsular and Oriental Company have
repeatedly broken or not performed their contract. Do the
Committee understand you to mean that it is one part of the
duty of Government to take precautions beforehand, that the
parties who make a contract shall be capable to perform the contract?&mdash;It
is their duty, but I believe in that instance they
neglected it.</p>

<p>2193. Do you think that if they had selected the owners of the
steamer “India,” they would have selected people more competent
to perform the contract?&mdash;To perform the China line; and I
may state as the reason, that we gave them a distinct account of
the number of ships at work there; the expense of the ships, and
also a description of the seas; and the very letter which I wrote
to them, as to the necessity of having a peculiar kind of vessel for
the China seas, has turned out perfectly true; and the protest, of
which we heard at the last meeting of the Committee, was in consequence
of that. The letter sent in to the Admiralty stated that
the Calcutta Company were in a better position to do that local
service than the Peninsular and Oriental Company, who have so
many interests to look after.</p>

<p>2194. The reason you did not compete with the Peninsular and
Oriental Company between Suez and Calcutta, was the impression
that you had that there was a determination at the Board of
Admiralty to favour them. Did you make any attempt to compete
with them between Ceylon and Hong Kong?&mdash;As to Suez
and Calcutta contract, it is like asking a man who has his hands
tied behind his back, to swim; as to Ceylon and Hong Kong
contract, the answer is plain enough on record, that we sent a
tender and got no answer.</p>

<p>2195. Am I right in understanding you to say, that you abstained
from competing with regard to the service between Suez
and Calcutta, because you thought the Peninsular and Oriental
Company too strong for you?&mdash;That was one reason expressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
by many persons; but if you ask my reason for not competing,
it was this: when I proposed to tender, the “Precursor” party were
in possession of the “Precursor,” but in the interim the Peninsular
and Oriental Company very advantageously obtained possession
of the “Precursor,” and we had no large vessels, and it was of no
use tendering without them.</p>

<p>2196. The reasons for not tendering for the contract between
Suez and Calcutta were two-fold; first, because there was
favouritism at the Admiralty, and secondly, you had not the
means of making the tender?&mdash;If the tenders were reasonable, I
ought to have had the means, because we ought to have been
allowed to build vessels; when they had bought the “Precursor,”
we were not in so good a position as we had been in before.</p>

<p>2197. If it was an object with the Government to make the
contract immediately, you would not be in a condition to make a
tender?&mdash;There was no necessity for a new contract; there was
no necessity for any change then, but it was got up by the
Peninsular and Oriental Company, by political agitation.</p>

<p>2198. I understand you to say, that if there was to be a contract
immediately, you were not in a condition to tender for it, as far
as regards Suez and Calcutta?&mdash;I was in a position to tender for
it, if reasonable tenders had been allowed.</p>

<p>2199. By reasonable tenders you mean that the Government,
instead of taking for the service ships that were then ready to do
it, should have waited eighteen months, in order that you might
be put in the same position?&mdash;There was no necessity to wait, as
the ships were bound to carry the mails, whether there was a new
contract or not.</p>

<p>2200. Your opinion is, that there was no necessity for a new
contract?&mdash;No, not for five years.</p>

<p>2201. In your opinion there ought to have been no contract at
all?&mdash;Not for the Bengal and Suez line, for five years.</p>

<p>2202. What ships were bound to carry the mails?&mdash;The three
ships which were bound to do the service were bound to maintain
a monthly communication.</p>

<p>2203. By what engagement?&mdash;By an engagement with the East
India Company they were bound to make a monthly communication
for £20,000 a year.</p>

<p>2204. Was there any such arrangement with the East India
Company?&mdash;Yes. I had ascertained that there was that arrangement
by correspondence, which is the usual way with great
companies.</p>

<p>2205. Did you ever read the correspondence which passed?&mdash;No;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
I know that certain deputations went; when I came home
from India, I found among the papers of the East Indian Steam
Company a document proving the terms upon which they were
to undertake it.</p>

<p>2206. Was it not an offer of the East India Company to give
£20,000 a year upon certain conditions?&mdash;Certainly not; there
was no offer of the East India Company.</p>

<p>2207. Your impression of the correspondence that you saw was,
that it was a distinct engagement on the part of the East India
Company to give that sum, and a distinct engagement on the
part of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Packet Company, at
all hazards, to perform the service?&mdash;Yes; but I should go
farther than that, in explanation.</p>

<p>2208. Your impression is, that it was an engagement binding
upon both parties; that the East India Company were bound to
pay that sum, and that the other parties were bound to perform the
service, whether they liked it or not?&mdash;My answer to that is, that
this £20,000 a year originated in an amalgamation, or at least a
pretended amalgamation, between the East Indian Steam Company
and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Packet Company,
in 1841. But inasmuch as on 14th October, 1839, the East India
Company had replied to the East Indian Steam Company in
London, and again in Calcutta, on the 27th of May, 1840, to the
inhabitants of Calcutta generally, “that to any well-devised
measures, by which the established means of communication
might be extended, the Court would be ready to afford due
encouragement; but in the present state of circumstances they
are unwilling now to enter into any arrangement affecting the
measures in progress regarding the communication between Suez
and Bombay;” that letter and publication was considered as an
engagement on the part of the East India Company to support
the extension of a line between Calcutta and Suez. The consequence
of that was, that the “Precursor” built for, and the “India”
was employed upon that line, under the supposition that they
would, when they had adopted this measure, be remunerated.
A junction was proposed between the small section of the London
shareholders of the East Indian Steam Company and the Peninsular
and Oriental Company; and what I say is, that they communicated,
either by deputation or by letter, with the East India
Company, and proposed that they should give them a grant of
£20,000 a year, holding forth that the three parties were to be
united. This was a long time in abeyance, but some time in
July, as it appears to me, the proposal of the Peninsular and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
Oriental Company was accepted by the East India Company;
but at the time it was accepted, it was accepted upon the recorded
opinion that the interests of the “India” and the “Precursor”
party were likely to be amalgamated with those of the Peninsular
and Oriental Company who had made the offer, and that upon
certain terms which are there stated; they were granted the
20,000 a year provided they made four voyages the first year, six
voyages the second year, and maintained a monthly communication
the third, fourth, and fifth year, with vessels of 500-horse
power, between Calcutta and Suez.</p>

<p>2209. Am I to understand you to state that the proposal or contract
to which you referred the other day, that the steamers should
be 500-horse power, originated with the East India Company?&mdash;No,
it originated with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Packet
Company.</p>

<p>2210. Then that excluded the “India?”&mdash;Yes; the conditions
are already in evidence, in answer to question 1819.</p>

<p>2211. What was the date of that condition which required vessels
of 1,600 tons and 500-horse power?&mdash;It was a proposal made
originally by the Peninsular and Oriental Company, early in the
year. I believe it was accepted about the middle of July, 1841;
but I was not in this country at the time.</p>

<p>2212. From that time to the present, the “India” was excluded
from the benefit of the arrangement?&mdash;She was excluded in
this way&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>2213. Was she of the requisite horse power?&mdash;I was going to
state how it was proved that she was not.</p>

<p>2214. That arrangement was made in the year 1841?&mdash;Yes; the
arrangement was made by the Court of Directors in July 1841.</p>

<p>2215. Then the “India” was from that time excluded from the
benefit of the arrangement?&mdash;Under the clause requiring 500-horse
power, the “India” was excluded; but the Peninsular and
Oriental Company proposed to purchase her, and after a good
deal of squabbling they offered us £23,000&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>2216. We do not want to go into that matter; but I understood
you to say that by the original conditions imposed by the East
India Company, in 1841, the steamer “India” was excluded from
the benefit of the arrangement?&mdash;She was excluded, but the
Peninsular and Oriental Company asked them to accept her.</p>

<p>2217. In your former examination, in answer to question 1835,
you stated, “The 500-horse power was put in purposely to exclude
all but the Peninsular Company’s vessels.” Will you state upon
what grounds you attribute to the Admiralty, in 1844, a condition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
which appears to have been in force against you, by the orders of
the East India Company, as early as 1841?&mdash;I had intended to
commence the examination by referring to my statement with
respect to that very case. It is so put here that I really cannot
understand it myself, and I must request to be allowed to make
the explanation of horse power; if you will allow me to make the
explanation of what I mean by horse power, I shall be able to
make my answers intelligible.</p>

<p>2218.  Are you a person of experience in nautical matters?&mdash;I
profess to know all that a man who has devoted his life to the
subject can know of the building and working of ships.</p>

<p>2219. And not only sailing ships, but steam vessels?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2220. Are there two meanings to the term “horse power!”&mdash;No;
“horse power” has no meaning at all; if you will allow
me to give an explanation I can state what it is.</p>

<p>2221. Before you give your explanation, allow me to ask this
question, whether you mean to say that the term “horse power”
has no meaning?&mdash;It has no meaning as to the capacity of ships
for carrying the mails; that I assert.</p>

<p>2222. Then when the East India Company, in 1841, put in a
clause that no vessel employed in carrying the mails should be less
than 500-horse power, they put in a clause which had no meaning
at all?&mdash;The East India Company never put in the clause at
all; it was put in by the Peninsular and Oriental Company, with
the very object of excluding us.</p>

<p>2223. Whoever put it in, it had no meaning?&mdash;No, it has not,
to my knowledge.</p>

<p>2224. Then, having no meaning, it had no operation or effect?&mdash;It
had the effect of excluding any other vessels but their own,
so long as it was allowed to remain.</p>

<p>2225. How did it have that effect?&mdash;The Peninsular and
Oriental Company having vessels of 500-horse power, which no
others had got, they of course obtained the contract.</p>

<p>2226.  You came here, on the previous day, charging the Admiralty
with having, in 1844, made a certain condition for the purpose
of excluding you, and you have now stated that that condition
was in force under the arrangement made by the East India Company
as early as 1841. Will you have the goodness to explain to
the Committee how it is that you attribute that to the Admiralty
in 1844, which appears to have originated with the East India
Company in 1841?&mdash;I was mistaken if I said it originated with
the East India Company; it originated with the Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Packet Company. The horse power of a vessel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
gives no means of knowing what the efficiency of the vessel is.
There is a good deal of the evidence of the former day which is of
no use, unless you allow me to explain what horse power is.
Those answers, as they stand, I cannot understand myself.</p>

<p>2227. Do you mean to say, that unless you are to be allowed to
show that the ordinary words “horse power,” when introduced
into a contract, render that contract unintelligible, you cannot
explain your case?&mdash;I never said that. May I be allowed to
state what I do mean; it takes a little time and a little trouble
to explain the meaning of “horse power.” The putting in the
“horse power” had no reference to the efficiency of the steam
vessels.</p>

<p>2228. Whatever the horse power meant in 1841, it meant in
1844?&mdash;Yes; but you are mistaken in supposing that I attribute
it to the East India Company putting in that condition; I
attributed it to the Peninsular and Oriental Company.</p>

<p>2229. We have here a contract made in 1844, by the Admiralty
on one side, and the Peninsular and Oriental Company on the
other; and you charge the Admiralty with having introduced a
certain condition for the purpose of excluding you, and of favouring
the Peninsular and Oriental Company?&mdash;No; I said that
the Peninsular and Oriental Company introduced the condition as
to the 400-horse power.</p>

<p>2230. How did they introduce it?&mdash;Because they proposed it.</p>

<p>2231. Do you find fault with a competitor for having proposed
vessels of a higher horse power than yourself?&mdash;I do; because
they did it to keep all other Companies out.</p>

<p>2232. What would you have had the Admiralty do?&mdash;I would
have had the Admiralty go and ascertain what the vessels were,
and not go upon the nominal horse power.</p>

<p>2233. You complain of the Admiralty going upon the individual
horse power?&mdash;-I do; it is a wrong system.</p>

<p>2234. Why do you complain of the Admiralty having done that
in 1844, which we find was part of the existing arrangement between
the East India Company and the Peninsular and Oriental
Company in 1841?&mdash;The question of horse power began with
the Peninsular and Oriental Company in 1840.</p>

<p>2235. And I to understand from you, that in your opinion the
Admiralty should have laid down no general condition about horse
power, but should have inquired into the capabilities of each
particular ship; is that your view?&mdash;Certainly, that is one view;
But as you said, just now, I had stated that the Peninsular and
Oriental Company had originated that condition about horse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
power; that is the hinge upon which all the mischief has
turned; and I will now, if I may be allowed, explain how it
occurred.</p>

<p>2236. The hinge upon which all the mischief has turned, has
been that condition about horse power?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2237. Whatever imputations you have made against the Admiralty
of favouritism, have turned upon improperly requiring a
compliance with that condition?&mdash;I do not say that; I say the two
things are quite distinct; but if you will allow me to state how it
did occur, I can explain it; I have a statement here to show how
it originated, and another statement to show what “horse power”
really means. I beg to state that the question of horse power
originated in 1840, and it was the proposal of the Peninsular
and Oriental Company; it originated with them, and not with the
Admiralty or the East India Company.</p>

<p>2254. Do you impute corrupt conduct to the Admiralty, in
reference to the ship “India?”&mdash;Certainly not; I think the
Committee are labouring under a mistake in that respect.</p>

<p>2255. If, in any part of your former examination, you have
been understood to impute either to the Board of Admiralty, or to
any other Government department, any favouritism towards the
Peninsular and Oriental Company, to the exclusion of their competitors,
you have been misunderstood?&mdash;As far as the facts are
on record, I could get no answer to my tender; I imputed
certainly not a corrupt motive, but I said that all along I believed
they were under a mistake, induced by this nominal “horse
power.”</p>

<p>2256. In answer to question 2216, you stated that in 1841 the
steamer “India” was excluded, by the conditions imposed by the
East India Company, but that the Peninsular and Oriental
Company wished them to accept her?&mdash;Yes, that is so.</p>

<p>2257. It was, therefore, the East India Company, and not
the Peninsular and Oriental Company, who insisted upon the
higher amount of horse power?&mdash;The two things are quite
distinct.</p>

<p>2258. Do you adhere to your answer to question 2216?&mdash;So far
it is correct that she was excluded, but the Peninsular Company,
after they had bought her, urged the East India Company to
accept her, and said she was an efficient vessel; they had abused
her before, but they then said she was efficient.</p>

<p>2259. Are you now speaking of 1841?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2260. Whose property was the steamer “India” in the year
1841?&mdash;She was the property of the Comprehensive party, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
sent her out; at the time this negotiation was going on she was in
Calcutta; I do not know what particular month this alludes to.</p>

<p>2261. It does not signify where she was?&mdash;It occurred in this
way: we will say it was in June; two months would alter the matter
altogether; there was a negotiation; the Peninsular and Oriental
Company told the representative of the “India” in this country,
Mr. Mackillop, that they would amalgamate with him; but the
moment they got the engagement signed, they abused the “India”
as much as they could; but when they found they could get her
for little or nothing, then they said they would take her for
£23,000, and they said “We will take her if the East India
Company will pay £20,000 for her hire.” And then they write
to the East India Company, and they say, notwithstanding the
condition about the 500-horse power, that she was an efficient
vessel.</p>

<p>2262. That was the opinion of the Peninsular and Oriental
Company?&mdash;Yes; after she was theirs.</p>

<p>2263. But at that time it was not the opinion of the East India
Company, and they refused it?&mdash;Yes. If you will allow me to
explain, I will show that there is a wide difference between the
mail contract and the engagement made with the Peninsular
Company.</p>

<p>2264. In your opinion the Admiralty, making the mail contract
on behalf of the public, were bound to accept a vessel that was not
good enough for the East India Company?&mdash;I never said so; but
perhaps you will allow me to put in an explanation of the horse
power; I have taken great pains in preparing it.</p>

<p>2265. This vessel, whatever be her merits, was rejected by the
East India Company in 1841, though tendered by the Peninsular
and Oriental Company at that time?&mdash;She was rejected in a
different way&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>2266. She was rejected, whatever the mode of rejection?&mdash;The
mistake is this: you fancy me to have said that the nominal
horse power was fixed by the East India Company or by the
Government; now that is a mistake; neither the one nor the
other fixed it.</p>

<p>2267. Can you answer the question whether the vessel was or
was not rejected by the East India Company?&mdash;She was rejected
because the Peninsular Company had proposed the condition with
regard to 500-horse power.</p>

<p>2268. Was the steamer “India” tendered to the East India
Company at the suit of the Peninsular and Oriental Company in the
year 1841, and rejected by the East India Company?&mdash;I was not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
in this country at the time, but it must be in the records of the
Company.</p>

<p>2269. Do you believe that your answer to question 2216 was a
true answer?&mdash;Yes, it was a true answer.</p>

<p>2270. And your case now against the Admiralty is, that they
rejected in 1844 the same ship which the East India Company
had rejected in 1841?&mdash;I cannot see that they have any reference
to each other.</p>

<p>2271. Do you complain of the steamer “India” being rejected
by the Admiralty in 1844?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2272. She having been rejected by the East India Company in
1841?&mdash;It was not for the same service, but for a very different
service; but she was, in fact, employed upon the line.</p>

<p>2273. I understood you to complain, that in the year 1844, the
Board of Admiralty laid down a certain condition with regard to
the horse power of the vessels to be employed in conveying the
mails between Suez and Calcutta, which condition excluded the
steamer “India?”&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2274. I understood you also to say, that that very same condition
as to the horse power had been previously laid down by
the East India Company, and that in the year 1841 the steamer
“India” was pressed upon the East India Company by the Peninsular
and Oriental Company, who had expected to buy her as
a good bargain; and that the East India Company, being so
pressed, refused to accept her?&mdash;I can now explain it.</p>

<p>2275. Is all that true?&mdash;Partly so, but not in the way you
put it.</p>

<p>2276. But are the facts true; yes or no. I have collected the
facts from your previous answers, and am putting them to you
again; if any one of them be inaccurate, point out the one which
is inaccurate?&mdash;You ask whether she was rejected in 1841; she
was. But allow me to give the reasons.</p>

<p>2277. Was she rejected for the service between Suez and
Calcutta in the year 1841?&mdash;She was refused to be received
under a certain engagement.</p>

<p>2278. Did the East India Company, in the year 1841, refuse to
accept the “India” steamer for the line between Suez and Calcutta?&mdash;Yes,
but that had no reference to her capacity as a mail
steamer.</p>

<p>2279. Be so good, then, as to explain the difference between the
two cases?&mdash;The difference was this: in 1841 it was the voluntary
proposition of the Peninsular and Oriental Company to undertake
the communication between Suez and Calcutta, with vessels of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
520-horse power; it was not for a mail contract, a mail contract
not being necessary; and they put in the 520-horse power with
the intention, I believe, of shutting out the “India” and other
vessels. It was for a passenger line, not for a mail line, because
the same mails were carried by Government vessels to Bombay,
and therefore there was no necessity for a mail line, or for her
service as a mail packet; but it had been an object of great consideration,
both by the Government at home and the inhabitants
of India, to have a passenger communication with Calcutta the
same to which the remuneration had been promised. The “India”
was on the spot, about to establish that, and the “Precursor”
was being prepared to extend it; the Peninsular and Oriental
Company came in with an engagement to do, for, apparently, a
very small sum, what those vessels were then about doing; that
was for the purpose of maintaining the passenger communication
between Calcutta and Suez. They offered to do this with vessels of
520-horse power as a passenger line, which was, of course, a good
deal better than doing it with vessels of 300-horse power, because
the object was the accommodation of passengers, and, no doubt,
a vessel of 520-horse power must have a great deal more accommodation
for passengers than one of 300-horse power; and therefore,
in asking the East India Company to accept a vessel of 300-horse
power, instead of a vessel of 520-horse power, they were simply
asking them to take a very considerable sum off their engagement.
That was a very different thing from carrying the mails, which
the “India” might have done; and, in fact, the experience of one
year has proved that she was capable of doing it.</p>

<p>2280. You having stated your view of the reasons which influenced
the East India Company, whether you are right in your
view of those reasons or not, the fact was, that the steamer
“India,” being pressed upon the East India Company by the
Peninsular and Oriental Company, was rejected; is that so?&mdash;I
understood that she was rejected, because it was not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>2281. Whatever were the reasons, was the fact so?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2282. And your opinion was, that the Admiralty ought to have
made in 1844 a different set of conditions, which would have
included the steamer “India?”&mdash;I think the Admiralty, having
the plans and specifications of the ship “India” before them,
ought to have judged from them as to the sufficiency of the
vessel, and not from the nominal horse power.</p>

<p>2283. Do you think that if a public department, instead of
laying down specific rules to which all parties must conform who
make engagements with regard to the specifications of particular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
vessels, that would be a better mode of excluding favouritism
than the mode which is now pursued?&mdash;Most assuredly it would
be a proper mode.</p>

<p>2284. Am I right in understanding that the “India” was, afterwards,
employed upon this very line by the Peninsular Company?&mdash;Yes,
and they got £15,000 a year by her. They bought her for less
than £15,000, and they patched her up for £1,000, and then got
her surveyed in 1845, and she remained for two or three years in
the contract ready to be employed, after being so patched up.</p>

<p>2285. Was she there as a reserve vessel?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2286. Was there any difference in the specification of horse
power for a reserve vessel, in comparison with the vessels which
were to carry the mails regularly?&mdash;Yes, there was a difference,
and she was admitted upon that.</p>

<p>2287. What was the amount of horse power required by the
contract for a reserve vessel?&mdash;I suppose it must have been less
than 300-horse power.</p>

<p>2288. Have you seen the contract?&mdash;Yes, but I do not recollect
whether it was 300 or 250-horse power.</p>

<p>2289. Is it not customary that the reserve vessel is of less
tonnage than the vessels which are regularly performing the
voyages with the mails?&mdash;Yes, it is so, and we intended her to
be so originally.</p>

<p>2290. When you tendered the “India,” did you propose her
as a reserve vessel, or as one of the regular vessels to carry the
mails?&mdash;We proposed her for the China line.</p>

<p>2291. You never proposed her for this line at all?&mdash;We could
not.</p>

<p>2292. With reference to the Ceylon and Hong Kong contract,
in the year 1844, did you tender the steamer “India” for the
Ceylon and Hong Kong contract?&mdash;-Yes.</p>

<p>2293. Your intention being that the mails should be carried as
far as Point de Galle by the Peninsular and Oriental Company,
and taken up at that point by you, and carried in your ships to
Hong Kong?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2294. How many vessels would that service have required?&mdash;It
would have required three vessels.</p>

<p>2295. How many vessels were you in possession of, at that
time?&mdash;We had one vessel.</p>

<p>2296. Where did you intend to get other vessels from?&mdash;We
offered to hire them in India, where we had four or five at our
disposal.</p>

<p>2297. You said the other day that it was not possible for you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
to guarantee any particular vessels in the Indian Seas as being
obtainable by you for that purpose?&mdash;We stated in the tender
that we would hire such vessels as we could procure, but we could
not do that, because no time was allowed.</p>

<p>2298. You said the other day that the “India,” being a paddle
ship, and over-built, was not particularly well qualified to deal
with the typhoons in the China seas?&mdash;She was not the vessel
that I would have chosen.</p>

<p>2299. You also told us that you had in your eye, as one of
the other vessels of the contract, a steamer which had gone to
China in the year 1830?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2300. Will you be so good as to state what, according to your
intention, was to have been the third ship by which the contract
was to be performed?&mdash;The tender states that two vessels were
to be built within a year for that purpose.</p>

<p>2301. But, speaking of time present, you intended to employ
the “India,” and to take the chance of a steamer which went
out to China in the year 1830, and to take the risk of your being
able to pick up a third vessel; was that your intention?&mdash;Yes;
but a company, of which I was a large proprietor, had five ships
in India besides the “India.”</p>

<p>2302. Was that company, of which you were a large proprietor,
able to guarantee that there would be other vessels to perform
the contract?&mdash;Certainly. I made this tender quite certain that
they would be very glad to employ their vessels there.</p>

<p>2303. Why, then, did you say, in answer to question 1931, that
you could not guarantee any vessels?&mdash;If we had not time to
offer it to them, and get an answer from them, I cannot say
that they might not turn round and refuse to let us have the
vessels.</p>

<p>2304. Did you expect the Admiralty, in the absence of any
guarantee, to form a contract with you to take the “India,” which
in your judgment was bad of her kind, as one ship, and to take a
steamer which went to China in the year 1830, and which you
thought you probably could get as a second ship, and the chance
of some third ship then in the Indian seas; upon that basis, did
you expect the Admiralty to form a contract with you; was that
so?&mdash;What I expect is stated in my former evidence.</p>

<p>2305. The “India” lay for a long time for sale in the London
docks, did she not, in 1839?&mdash;I think, for three or four months,
she lay there for sale.</p>

<p>2306. Was she not put up for sale at Lloyd’s?&mdash;Yes, I believe
she was.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>2307. Who were the owners of the “India” when she sailed
for India?&mdash;An old gentleman from Norfolk, a Mr. Banyan, was
the registered owner.</p>

<p>2308. He was not the real owner?&mdash;Yes, he was a real owner;
she belonged to a company got up by Captain Ross, and he represented
them.</p>

<p>2309. When she went to India, was she not mortgaged?&mdash;Yes,
she was.</p>

<p>2310. To what amount?&mdash;She was under two mortgages, I understood,
but what the other mortgage was I do not remember.
There was $20,000 advanced to the builders, as stated in answer
to question 1814; but she was not under mortgage when I
tendered her for contract mail service. The real owners were
some forty residents and natives in India, and seven firms and
individuals in England, who purchased her from the mortgagees,
and established the India Steam Company of Calcutta
in 1841.</p>

<p>2311. You have stated that the “India” has been running on
the line between Calcutta and Suez?&mdash;I never said that she was
running on the line; she was employed on the line; she was
receiving a certain portion of the money paid for the contract. I
suppose about £15,000 a year would be her proportion.</p>

<p>2312. Are you aware that she never left her moorings?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2313. The Peninsular and Oriental Company bought her, did
they not?&mdash;Yes; after a desperately hard bargain.</p>

<p>2314. Are you aware that she was full of dry rot at the time they
bought her?&mdash;Yes, but I am aware that they deducted £1,300
from the £15,000 which they engaged to pay, in consequence of
that; and I am also aware that they told me it would require
£15,000 to repair her when they offered £23,000 for her; and
I sent in the same drawings that I had sent in to the Admiralty,
and offered to do it for £8,000, upon which they said, we will
give you £15,000.</p>

<p>2315. Are you aware that the “India” has been broken up?&mdash;I
never heard it till now.</p>

<p>2316. You stated that the Peninsular Company sent out to the
China line two old vessels?&mdash;Yes, they were used in the Peninsular
lines.</p>

<p>2317. What were their names?&mdash;The “Lady Mary Wood” was
one, and the “Braganza” was the other.</p>

<p>2318. Are you not aware that in 1844 the “Lady Mary Wood”
was only two years old?&mdash;Yes, I know it perfectly.</p>

<p>2319. Would you call her an old vessel?&mdash;Yes, she had been a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
good deal used there; the best proof of her age is, that she was
inefficient before she could be relieved.</p>

<p>2320. How do you know that?&mdash;I have heard so.</p>

<p>2321. Are you aware that the “Braganza” was within a few
months of the same age as the “India?”&mdash;I do not know that;
I know that she had some repairs before she went there; such
repairs as I should have given the “India.”</p>

<p>2322. You said that you expected to hire in India a vessel called
the “Fire Queen?”&mdash;I never said a word about the “Fire Queen;”
the “Fire Queen” we had nothing to do with; the vessels which
I mentioned are mentioned here.</p>

<p>2323. It is in the answer to question 2135: “In Bengal,
the ‘Forbes,’ ‘India,’ ‘Dwarkanauth Tagore,’ ‘Henderson,’
and ‘Gordon;’ at Singapore, ‘The Royal Sovereign,’ ‘Express,’
and ‘Windsor Castle;’ on her passage out to India, the
‘Fire Queen,’ built for a Calcutta Company?”&mdash;If you look you
will see that those are mentioned as the ships that are in India,
I did not say that I had them; that is a quotation from a letter
to Mr. Sidney Herbert, stating that there are those vessels there.</p>

<p>2324. But the India Steam Company possessed no other vessel
than the “India,” did they?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>2325. In one of your answers you stated first, that “no honest
man,” which you afterwards qualified by saying, “no man intending
to act honestly, would sign a contract with such stringent
clauses and penalties for over-times on arrivals?”&mdash;I did not say,
“no honest man” would sign it. I said that you would not like
to undertake such things, if you could not honestly undertake to
do them.</p>

<p>2326. Did you allude to the penalties for non-arrival in proper
time?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2327. I suppose you have read these contracts attentively?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>2328. And know them by heart, probably?&mdash;No, I do not
think I know them by heart.</p>

<p>2329. Has it escaped you that there is this clause in the contract:
“The contractors are not to be liable to any penalties under
this contract for any matters arising from circumstances over
which they and their servants had not and could not have had
any control, and which shall be so proved to the satisfaction of
the said Commissioners?”&mdash;I do not recollect that particularly;
there was some such clause.</p>

<p>2330. Did you ever see that clause before?&mdash;I see that if a
vessel should have a very foul wind and could not get on, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
clause would perhaps meet that case. But there are a great
many causes from which an engine might break down, which
would not be provided for by that clause.</p>

<p>2331. You particularly specified stringent clauses, and alluded
to the penalties for arrival after time; you said that the clauses
were so stringent that no honest man, or no man intending
honestly, would sign the contract, because there were penalties
for arriving over time?&mdash;I was speaking then with reference to
the tenders, which I got in 1840. This is the contract I was
speaking of. I saw that the first condition was, that they were
to be properly built and efficient vessels of 400-horse power; and
then there are a number of clauses which I have marked here;
the result of them is, first, that the contract was to provide for
the passages being performed in a certain number of hours, under
a penalty of £500 for twelve hours’ delay.</p>

<p>2332. With such a clause as that you would be afraid to make
such a contract?&mdash;It exactly amounts to what I say; it is of no
use to put such a condition into a contract, except to keep people
away.</p>

<p>2333. In answer to a question put to you by the Chairman
(1816), which was, “Whatever the nature of the arrangement
between the India Company and the Peninsular Company was,
the result is that they received £20,000 a year for five years,
from the spring of 1841, for doing certain services; is that so?”
you answer, “Yes.” Is that answer correct, that for five years
they received £20,000 a year?&mdash;That is a mistake; they were
to receive that.</p>

<p>2334. For how many years did they receive that £20,000 under
the letter of the East India Company?&mdash;For two years.</p>

<p>2335. You have been speaking about screw vessels; did you
ever command one?&mdash;No.</p>

<h3><i>Inspection of the Company’s Affairs by the
Government.</i></h3>

<p>It will have been observed, from the evidence of Mr.
Croker of the Admiralty (see page 27), that in consequence
of the Directors offering to the Government the
permission to investigate the accounts and books of the
Company, the Admiralty appointed Capt. A. Ellice, R.N.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
the comptroller of steam machinery, and previously superintendent
of the packet service at Southampton, together
with Mr. W. H. Bond, an experienced accountant, connected
with the civil department of the naval service, to
make that Investigation. The following is their Report,
which, although it was considered by the Admiralty as a
confidential one, and therefore not to be published without
the consent of the Company, the Directors had no
hesitation in permitting to be produced to the Committee,
and which has, accordingly, been published in the
Appendix to the Committee’s Report.</p>

<p>
Admiralty, 16 June, 1848.<br />
</p>

<p>In compliance with the instructions of the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, contained in their minute of the 30th
ultimo, “To ascertain whether the profit of the voyages between
Southampton, Malta, and Alexandria, have been such as
would provide a dividend of 10 per cent. per annum on the
capital, after the ordinary deductions of wear and tear, and sea
risk of vessels,&mdash;if the directors had not thought fit to invest a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
portion of their profits in the extension of the stock, by the
purchase of additional vessels:”</p>

<p>“Also to endeavour to institute a comparison between the
expenses of carrying on the mail services by the company, and
those which are incurred by her Majesty’s naval service in
similar duties:”&mdash;Application was made to the directors of the
Peninsular and Oriental Company to furnish a copy of the
balance-sheet for the last half year, ending the 1st March, 1848,
together with such other documents as would serve to explain
the various items contained in it. These being furnished, the
readiest access was afforded to the ledger and other books of
the company, for their verification.</p>

<p>As these accounts are kept so as to include all the operations
of the company, without distinguishing the profits on the different
branches, it became necessary, in order to carry out the
spirit of their Lordship’s instructions, to inquire into the state
of the company’s affairs generally; and to conduct this inquiry
in such a way as to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion on the
following points:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Whether the postal duties performed by the Peninsular
and Oriental Steam Company are proportionate to the amount
paid for those duties.</p>

<p>2. Whether such duties can, with advantage, be transferred
from the contract steam vessels to those of her Majesty’s navy.</p>

<p>3. The propriety of throwing these duties open to public
competition.</p>

<p>4. The expediency of accepting the Peninsular and Oriental
Company’s proposal for a modification of the terms of the
contract.</p>

<p>Upon these important points the most careful and mature
consideration has been bestowed; all the documents have been
closely examined and compared with the books of the company,
and the following are the results which are submitted for their
Lordships’ information:&mdash;</p>

<p>First. That the amount paid to the Peninsular and Oriental
Company for the duties it has performed has not hitherto been
more than it was justly entitled to receive, on the principle
that the shareholders are entitled to a fair commercial profit on
the capital invested in the undertaking, and admitting that the
affairs of the company have been managed, as they appear to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
have been, with economy and efficiency. The dividend hitherto
made has never reached the amount of 10 per cent. per annum,
and the additions made to their shipping and other capital are
from reserves to meet contingencies. The principles on which
these reserves have been laid aside, instead of being divided as
profits, will be hereafter explained in this report.</p>

<p>Second. That the present inadequate means of ascertaining
the expense of her Majesty’s steam vessels, especially in the
Indian and China seas, renders it difficult to determine the
comparative pecuniary results which would follow the transfer
of the duties. Considering, however, the difficulty of adapting
her Majesty’s vessels to commercial purposes, accommodation
of passengers and freight of merchandise, and the superior
convenience and advantages of mercantile companies in these
respects, the success or expediency of such a change is exceedingly
doubtful, except on a necessity, arising from exorbitant
demands for carrying the mails by contract.</p>

<p>Third. Considering that the postal duties have been well and
satisfactorily performed; that the company has never been fined
for any breach of contract; that it has never asked for any
increase of remuneration, or decrease of the duties to be performed,
as has been the case in other instances of contract with
companies; considering, also, the energetic manner in which
this company has persevered in extending steam communication
through new and untried channels, and that it has formed
extensive establishments on the faith of the continued support
of the Government, and that it still contemplates an extension
of its communications with the farthest southern and eastern
point of the British possessions; establishing for these proposes
a steam navy of considerable magnitude, at the command of the
public, on any emergency,&mdash;it appears to be entitled to as much
consideration as is compatible with an economical administration
of the duties of the Post-office.</p>

<p>Fourth. That for reasons hereafter suggested, the contract
may now with great propriety be brought under conditions
more favourable to the Government; and that this may be
done either by a fixed reduction for a permanent term, or on a
scale varying with the profits of the company.</p>

<p>In either case it will appear essential that any new arrangement
to be made should rather be of a permanent than
of a temporary character, both to ensure confidence to the
company in the conduct and extension of their concerns,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
and efficiency in the discharge of the service entrusted to
them.</p>

<p>The reasons for adopting these results, which are submitted
with great deference to their Lordships’ consideration, are
founded upon facts contained in the following statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>First: As regards the duties performed, and payments made.</p>

<p>The annexed table, No. 1, shows the routes, distances, and
amounts of the existing contracts. Of these, the third route
has been recently transferred to Government vessels. From
this return it appears that hitherto the company has been paid
the sum of £224,525, which, however, has been reduced by this
transfer to £209,000.</p>

<p>For the performance of these duties, and the other business
of the company, the establishment of vessels detailed in the
annexed table, No. 2, is in efficient operation, with the exception
of the “Ariel,” recently stranded in the vicinity of Leghorn.</p>

<p>The original project fixed the capital at £1,000,000, but
the amount paid up was, and remains, at the sum of
£973,378 16s. 8d. In addition to this capital, reserved
amounts have been credited, arising from undivided profits,
under the heads of “Repair,” “Insurance,” and “Depreciation”
funds, amounting to £306,424 19s. 2d., as will be seen by the
annexed statement, No. 3.</p>

<p>The balance-sheet of the company, No. 4, shows the last
half-yearly expenditure to amount to £238,404 19s.; and the
receipts, including the amount paid by the Government for the
conveyance of mails, £301,034 10s. 2d.</p>

<p>Some idea of the extent of this establishment may be formed
from the following items of expenditure:&mdash;</p>

<p>For the half-year ending the 31st March last, the company
disbursed for the shipping department alone&mdash;</p>

<p>Beyond 2½ per cent. on the freight and passage-money, paid to
the directors under the head of management; and 5 per cent.
on the profit balance on closing the account, paid on the same
account.</p>

<p>These charges of 2½ per cent. on the freight and passage-money,
and 5 per cent. on the balance, include, beyond all
other expenses of management, allowance to the managing
directors, for conducting the affairs of the company, to the net
amount of from £15,000 to 16,000 per annum.</p>

<p>This remuneration is paid to them under the deed of settlement,
and has probably secured to the shareholders an efficiency
and economy in the general arrangements which have contributed
greatly to the success of the concern; at the same
time it may be doubted whether, in estimating the profits of
the company, the amount paid to the directors may not be considered
(beyond the usual compensation for such services) as
part of the general profits, rather than as a charge of management.</p>

<p>The principles on which the reserved funds have been laid
aside appear fair and reasonable.</p>

<p>The insurance is at a rate of 5 per cent. on the first cost of
the vessels employed, after deducting the amount already
carried to depreciation account; out of which amount the premiums
for insurance at Lloyd’s are paid on such assurances as
are effected there, the balance being added to the insurance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
fund. The portion of the insurance actually effected is at
rather a higher rate than the 5 per cent. It would not be fair,
therefore, to include any portion of this reserved fund in an
estimate of the company’s profits as shipowners or mail contractors.
It belongs fairly to them in their character of insurers,
as, if they had insured the full value of their property, it
would have been paid to underwriters.</p>

<p>The depreciation fund is calculated at a rate of 5 per cent.
per annum on the first cost of the vessels, after deducting the
amount previously carried to the same account.</p>

<p>The repair fund is at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum,
calculated on the same amount as the preceding; and it will be
seen that the sum thus reserved for the last six months was
£37,633 13<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, which did not provide for the actual expenditure
of £39,630 6<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i></p>

<p>So far, therefore, as the affairs of the company have hitherto
proceeded, the amount paid to them under the contract would
not appear to have exceeded a reasonable remuneration for the
services performed, on the principles before stated.</p>

<p>Second: The comparative advantages which might result
from the employment of her Majesty’s vessels, instead of contract
vessels, for the performance of those duties, appears to be
a question of somewhat difficult solution.</p>

<p>The present mode of keeping the accounts of the navy, and
the commixture of expenditure for the steam and other departments
in the dockyards and public offices, must render it exceedingly
difficult to ascertain the cost of any separate branch
of service.</p>

<p>Supposing, however, that the financial comparison could be
made, yet there are many other important elements in the consideration
of the subject.</p>

<p>For the rapid and secure performance of the public mail duty,
no branch of the mercantile marine is so well prepared as her
Majesty’s naval department. But by the employment of her
Majesty’s vessels, light merchandise could not be conveyed;
the habits and comforts of the passengers could never be so well
provided for as by persons paid for such duties; and as regards
the troublesome details of carrying passengers, freight, and
merchandise, the war steamer must be less adapted than the
merchant vessel.</p>

<p>It must be recollected, also, that a sufficient number of
vessels must be fitted up, equipped, provisioned, stored, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
specially and exclusively adapted to and employed upon this
service; and that fresh arrangements, depôts, and agencies
along the lines of route would be required; the preparation for
such services would therefore be necessarily attended with an
expense which years of any probable saving could scarcely
defray.</p>

<p>Third: The question then arises whether, in the continued
employment of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Company’s
vessels, considering the actual condition and the established
profits and credit of the company, owing in some measure to
the existing contract, some modification of the terms, for the
advantage of the public, may not be fairly expected.</p>

<p>With a view to the consideration of this question, the following
facts are submitted.</p>

<p>The general transactions of the last half-year, the best period
for judging clearly the present operation of the company, furnish
the following points:</p>

<p>The dividend to the shareholders, at the rate of 4 per cent.
for six months, or 8 per cent. per annum, on the original
capital of £973,378, amounted to £38,933, leaving a surplus
balance of about £6,781, to be carried to the next account.</p>

<p>If even the amount paid to the directors from the 2½ per
cent. (deducted for charges of management, being for a half
year, £8,248 10s. 9d.), were added to the surplus balance of
£6,781, and a dividend paid to the proprietors at the rate of
10 per cent., the scale suggested by their lordships, a residue
would only be left of about £5,296; from which residue the
expenses of management, and ordinary salaries for managing
directors, would have to be defrayed.</p>

<p>Their lordships will thus have before them the means of considering
what modification of the terms of the contract the
present and prospective state of the profits of the company
would appear to justify; or whether it would be expedient to
adopt such modification to the varying profits of the company
in the terms proposed by it; viz., that when the financial
position of the company, with respect to such mail services,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
shall be such as, after making the customary allowances for the
repairs, &amp;c., a maximum dividend of 10 per cent. can be realised
to the shareholders, any surplus over and above such maximum
dividend shall be placed to the credit of the Government.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Copy of a Memorandum made by</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowper</span> <i>on the Contract
for the Calcutta Mails, after the receipt of the Report of
Investigation by</i> Captain <span class="smcap">Ellice</span> <i>and</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Bond</span>, <i>and sent
to</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Auckland</span>.</p>

<p>“The contract for the Calcutta mails, from Southampton to
Alexandria, expires on the 8th January, 1849. Two offers have
been made for its renewal, one by the Peninsular and Oriental
Company, for £27,500 the first year, and for sums diminishing
by £500 a year for every subsequent year that the contract
may remain in force. A new company, the India and Australia,
offer to do the same service for £25,650; the sum now paid is
£28,500.</p>

<p>“The Peninsular and Oriental Company accompanied their
tender by an offer to pay over to the Government any earnings
or profits they might receive beyond a maximum dividend of ten
per cent. to the shareholders, after the customary allowances
have been deducted for repairs, wear and tear, and sea risk of
the vessels and property; and as a security, they offered to
submit, from time to time, the accounts of all their transactions
connected with the mail service, to the inspection of such competent
persons as the Government may appoint.</p>

<p>“Captain Ellice and Mr. Bond were then requested to
examine the accounts of this company before any decision was
come to upon the tenders; and having had every facility afforded
them, have made the accompanying report. From this it
appears that the profits made upon the capital of the company,
about equal ten per cent. as a total sum; but that after
reserves for depreciation, repairs and insurance, and expenses
of management, there has remained hitherto not more than eight
per cent. for the shareholders. The question of how much of
the earnings ought to be kept in reserve to meet depreciation,
is so discretionary that I have no expectation that any company
would ever admit that there was a surplus profit to be handed
over to Government; and this report confirms my impression,
that we ought not to make such an arrangement a part of the
contract.</p>

<p>“But I think both the tenders too high, and that we ought
to decline them both; and this we can do without irregularity,
for they are not tenders called for absolutely, but only tenders
‘to treat.’</p>

<p>“If this be done, we should then make an offer on our part;
and as the Peninsular and Oriental Company have performed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
their contract perfectly, and furnish every guarantee that can
be desired for the regular execution of a future contract, I
consider that we ought to make our offer to them only; and if
they should refuse it, we might repeat it to the India and
Australia Company.</p>

<p>“The mileage we pay them at present is estimated by the
hydrographer at 8s. 0<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>d. a mile and by the company at
7s. 9<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>d. a mile (he measures the distance of the voyage out
and back at 5,920 nautical miles, they at 6,084); but we pay
the same company about 4s. 6d. a mile for the line to Lisbon
and Gibraltar, and I think we are justified in offering the same
payment for the Alexandria line. But in that case we must
not tie them down as to size of vessels, for the lowness of the
remuneration on the former line is explained by the contract
not requiring the vessels to be more than 140-horse power.</p>

<p>“To this department the size of the vessels is a matter of
indifference, we care only that it be sufficient to secure speed;
and we should stipulate only for a certain rate of speed.</p>

<p>“If my proposition be adopted we should immediately signify
to the parties that their tenders are not accepted, and
make a communication to the Treasury.</p>

<p>“I omitted to mention, that by directions from the Treasury
we fixed the duration of the contract for which we demanded
tenders, at three years; and also, that a reason for offering
4s. 6d. a mile may be found in the agreement made in May,
1845, by this same company, to convey mails between Southampton
and Alexandria, in vessels of 280-horse power, as far
as Malta; and of 180-horse power between Malta and Alexandria,
for £15,525, which gives a mileage of about 4s. 6d.
This agreement was entered into for only one year, since the
company complained of its lowness, and declined, on that
account, to make a formal and permanent contract at that
rate; but they have continued it ever since, and it has been
terminated by ourselves in May last.</p>

<h5>MAIL CONTRACT TO ALEXANDRIA.</h5>

<p class="author">
“27th June, 1848.</p>

<p>“I think with Captain Ellice and Mr. Bond, that we should
desire to conclude an arrangement with the Oriental in preference
to any other company, for the present contract has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
been loyally kept, and the capital and means of that company
give better promise of efficiency and exactness than could be
looked for in any other quarter. The Indian and Australian
Company is indeed supported by good names, but it has yet no
paid-up capital, or body of shareholders, or organised establishment
on which we could depend; and though it may be desirable
to establish a rivalry and competition on the line of communication,
It would not be wise to do so at the hazard of uncertainty
and interruption. We have, however, advertised for
tenders; and though we are not bound to take the lowest
offer, we should scarcely be justified in rejecting it without
a fair examination of its value. The first question, however,
must be, which is the lowest offer? The Oriental Company
propose to perform the service in the first instance, for
£27,500; the other company for £25,650. But the Oriental
are ready to lower their charge by sums of £500 in the
second, £1,000 in the third, £1,500 in the fourth, and
£2,000 in the fifth year, or £5,000 in the five years. This
would reduce the difference between the two companies to only
£850 annually, in the event of the contract winning for five
years, or to £1,350 if it should be taken for three years. But
the Oriental further offer to the Government a share in their
profits on this line, whatever they may be beyond 10 per cent.
paid to the shareholders. It is difficult to calculate to what
this might amount, or to determine upon what principle it should
be calculated. The dividend to the shareholders has not yet
amounted to more than eight per cent., but large sums have
been applied to new capital, to reserve funds, for insurance,
and to other purposes. There may be profit on the Mediterranean
line, and there may be loss on other lines, and an
annual inquiry into all these matters might lead to endless discussions
and disputes, and would be a source of frequent
vexation to both parties. It is clear, however, that the company
makes considerable profits, and I would prefer, to a share
in them under the exercise of an inquisitorial power, a liberal
compromise by a reduction of the terms which have been proposed;
and I think that this reduction should be to a sum considerably
lower than the £25,650 which has been tendered by the
Indian and Australian Company. Mr. Cowper would reduce
the sum demanded to about £15,000, taking the mileage at
4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, the price of the Lisbon, instead of 8<i>s.</i> 0<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub><i>d.</i>, the mileage
of the Mediterranean packets. I doubt whether these terms
would not be too hard. The Lisbon packets are less efficient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
and less expensive than those of the Mediterranean, and though
the profits of the latter are large at some seasons of the year,
there are months when passengers to India are rare, and the
receipt small.</p>

<p>“I am inclined to propose a middle term between the
£16,000 and the £27,500, and to offer £22,000 for five years, as
a fixed sum, without condition for periodical reductions, or for
a share in the company’s profits; but before this is determined
on, I should like to have further opinions upon the result which
may be drawn from the company’s accounts.</p>

<p>“I have carefully looked into them, and I find it difficult to
decide upon what portion of the receipts is to be regarded as
net profit, and what portion of disbursement is to be referred

capital which has taken place in twelve years, the profit must
have been large.</p>

<h2 id="CONCLUDING_REMARKS">CONCLUDING REMARKS.

<img class="figcenter" src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></h2>

<p>The preceding statement and evidence can scarcely
fail to force on the conviction of every unbiassed mind
“the following conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the Company owes its present extensive employment
in the Contract Mail Packet Service to no
other circumstance than that of having placed itself, by
its own enterprise, in a position to execute that Service
with greater advantage to the public interests than could
otherwise he obtained.</p>

<p>2. That in the planning, undertaking, and executing
of that Service, it has realised important benefits to the
public, whether considered in a financial, political, social,
or commercial point of view.</p>

<p>And, looking to its present position,&mdash;namely, the
possession of an ample capital and means&mdash;of extensive
practical experience in the management of steam navigation&mdash;a
well-organised establishment of agencies at its
numerous stations abroad&mdash;exclusive docking accommodation
for its large ships at the principal ports of
India&mdash;extensive main or trunk lines of communication,
established in the principal tracks of Oriental intercourse,
and to which any further extension of postal
communication must of necessity subserve, as auxiliaries
or feeders,&mdash;there is scarcely room for entertaining a
reasonable doubt that the Peninsular and Oriental Company
will be able to maintain its ground, both in respect
to the Services in which it is already engaged, as well as
in the undertaking of any further Services which may be
required in the East, against any <i>boná fide</i> competition,
and on the same legitimate, and, therefore, invulnerable
basis on which its present connexion with the Contract
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Packet Service has been established,&mdash;namely, its capability
of maintaining the present, and undertaking such
future Services, with the greatest advantage to the public
interests, both as to efficiency and economy.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Benefits of the Contract Packet Service, and of
Steam Communications with our Dependencies
and Foreign Countries.</i></p>

<p>The advantage, as regards economy of the public
expenditure, of maintaining these communications by
means of private enterprise under Contract, instead of by
Government vessels, managed by Government establishments,
has now been fully recognised.</p>

<p>It has, however, been the practice in some quarters<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
to estimate the value of these communications, and the
expediency of maintaining them, by the amount of
postage of letters which they produce.</p>

<p>A more narrow and unstatesmanlike view of the
question can scarcely be entertained; and a slight consideration
of the following facts will suffice to show that
such a mode of estimating their value to the public is
extremely fallacious.</p>

<p>Who, that has had any experience of the operations of
commerce, or of the practical business of Government,
would estimate the value of an accelerated and certain
transit of a merchant’s letter or a Government despatch
by the amount of postage which the one brings in, or the
other would bring in, to the revenue?</p>

<p>The rapid transit of the merchant’s letter is often the
means of originating a commercial operation which gives
employment to hundreds of artizans and labourers, thus
increasing production and expenditure, and thereby
returning into the exchequer, in taxes on consumption,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
thousands of times the comparatively trifling cost of its
conveyance.</p>

<p>And how often does the acceleration of the public
despatch facilitate the duties and contribute to the lessening
of the expenses of Government? Instances are not
unknown where the rapid transit of a despatch has saved
an expenditure for warlike supplies and operations, to
the amount of many hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p>

<p>That facility of intercourse and transit creates and
increases commerce, is a fact which experience has
abundantly established. A circumstance strikingly illustrative
of it, and connected with one branch only of this
Company’s operations, was stated in evidence before the
Parliamentary Committee of last session on the Steam
Navy, and is as follows,&mdash;viz.:</p>

<h4><i>Extract from the Evidence of Mr. Anderson, M.P., a
Member of the Committee.</i></h4>

<p>But I wish to remark that, to estimate the value of these
communications merely by the postage of the letters carried,
I consider to be a very erroneous estimate; there are incidental
public advantages arising from those communications which I
consider far to overbalance the cost of them; for instance, by
facilitating the communications with those foreign countries and
dependencies, you promote the increase of your commerce.
And I will mention one fact, which I think will illustrate the
opinion I am now giving. About some six or seven years
since, the merchants connected with Constantinople and the
Levant were very desirous of having steam communication established
with those places, and the Company with which I am
connected were willing to establish such communication; but
the returns being rather uncertain, while the expenses were
certain and very heavy, they considered they were scarcely
warranted in entering upon such an enterprise without some
assistance. It was proposed to the then Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Mr. Goulburn, that he should make some allowance,
some few thousand pounds, for an improvement which was proposed
to be made in the postal arrangements with Constantinople,
and which would have reduced the post between London
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
and Constantinople to thirteen days, instead of twenty-four.
Mr. Goulburn objected to entertain the matter, but subsequently
the communication was established. I find, in looking
to the statistics of our export trade, that comparing the amount
of our exports to the quarters to which those steamers run,
previous to their establishment, with the amount at the end of
the year 1846, there was an increase of about £1,200,000 a
year. I find also that the actual value of the goods exported
in those steamers from Southampton last year amounted to
within a very trifling fraction of one million sterling. And referring
to several Greek merchants connected with the trade,
of much intelligence, for the cause of that increase, they told
me that they felt perfectly certain that the establishment of the
steam communication had been the great cause of the increase
of the trade. I asked them on what grounds they formed that
opinion, and they said it was upon these grounds: that the
steam communication enabled them to turn their capital over a
great deal oftener than by sailing vessels; that it gave them a
certainty as to the time their goods could be in the market, and
they also had a certainty of return for their exports. That no
less than forty new Greek mercantile establishments had been
formed in this country, since the time of the establishment of
those steamers. Supposing those assumptions to be correct,
which I believe they are, or nearly so, I think I am warranted
in forming the opinion that the revenue has been very greatly
increased, inasmuch as the trade is of the most valuable nature
for the employment of our artizans and labourers. The exports
consist of manufactured goods of the finest class; and the imports
of raw material, as for example, silks and goats’ wool,
coming here to be manufactured. I am informed that the wages
of labour on this fine class of manufactured goods amount to about
two-thirds of their value. Assuming that to be the case, and
that the trade has been increased by means of the steam communication
with Constantinople and the Levant to the extent
of about £1,000,000 sterling, that is taking the exports and
imports together, £600,000 of that amount have been paid to
artizans and labourers, and expended by them for the supply of
their ordinary wants. And as the proportion which goes to the
revenue in the shape of direct and indirect taxes is usually estimated
at about twenty per cent. of such expenditure, it follows
that the national exchequer has been benefited to the amount
of twenty per cent. on £600,000, or say £120,000 per annum,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
by the establishment of that steam communication. The effects,
therefore, of those communications are, I submit, to increase
trade and industry, and consequently the public revenue, while
they at the same time provide us with an important means of
maritime defence in case of need.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p class="small">The first thirty-two vessels being of the tonnage and power of the steam
frigates of the Royal Navy&mdash;the remaining twelve vessels of the power and
tonnage of the steam sloops and gun vessels of the Royal Navy.</p>

<p>By a stipulation in the Mail Contracts, these vessels,
with the exception of a few which are under 400-horse
power, are required to be so constructed as to be able to
carry and fire guns of the largest calibre used in the war
steamers, and the Government have the power of employing
them for warlike purposes, if required. The
vessels under 400-horse power are included in the above
list, as they would, without doubt, be also placed at the
disposal of the Government if required.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>Assuming that this reserve fleet supersedes the necessity,
as it surely ought to do, of the employment of war
steamers to the extent of only one-fourth of its number,
a financial saving to the country of from £250,000 to
£300,000 per annum on that account is due to the
Contract Packet Service.</p>

<p>The annual amount paid to these three Companies for
the East India and China, Mediterranean and Peninsular,
West Indian, Mexican, &amp;c., and North American Contract
Mail Services is £589,000. The returns for postage,
as estimated by the Post-office, is about £380,000&mdash;leaving
an apparent cost to the pubic of £209,000 for
these communications.</p>

<p>But it appears, from the circumstance stated by Mr.
Anderson, that at least half of this apparent deficiency is
made good to the exchequer by taxes on consumption,
proceeding from the increase of commerce and industrial
resources consequent on the establishment of <i>one branch</i>
of <i>one Company’s</i> communications only; and it surely
cannot be an exaggerated estimate to assume that the
whole of the other improved communications of that
and the other Companies make good to the exchequer,
in a similar manner, at least the other half.</p>

<p>It therefore follows, looking at the question as a merely
financial one, that the establishment and maintenance of
these communications, so far from being any burden on
the national exchequer, is a gain to it; their cost being
more than returned to it in postage of letters, <i>and revenue
derived from the increase of industry and consumption
created by their means</i>; in addition to which the country
is, or ought to be, a gainer, to the extent of not less than
a quarter of a million sterling in a reduction of naval
expenditure, seeing that a large reserve steam navy,
promptly available for the national defence, if required,
is provided by these great steam navigation enterprises.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
That reserve navy also, while forming so important an
auxiliary to the means of national defence in case of war,
is operating as one of the most effective instruments for
the maintenance of peace, by promoting the extension of
foreign commercial intercourse&mdash;thereby tending to bind
nations closer together by the strongest of all ties, that of
mutual dependence on each other for their material wants.
Assuming these facts and conclusions to be correct,
instead of the expense of these communications being
grudged, it ought to be regarded as the most beneficial
outlay of public money that occurs in the whole balance-sheet
of our national expenditure.</p>

<p>Although, in the preceding remarks, the benefits of these
improved postal communications have been considered
only in reference to their financial, commercial, and political
importance, it ought not to be forgotten that they
also involve social benefits, of equal, if not superior consideration.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
How few are the instances, comparatively
speaking, where a family in the United Kingdom is to be
met with who has not one or more of its members absent
in our distant dependencies, engaged in industrial pursuits,
or in the public service of their country. To lessen the
hardships of absence and separation to so large a portion
of the community, by facilitating to them the means of
social intercommunication, reducing, as it were, the distance
which separates them (as has been done in many
cases, to less than one-fourth of what it formerly was) is
surely an object worthy of national sympathy and solicitude,
and claiming to be supported by national means.</p>

 The investigation has since been completed, and the Admiralty have
acquitted the Company of the charge of overloading the vessels, and of any
breach of contract. One principal cause of the vessels being occasionally
beyond the time stipulated in the contract, in arriving at Hong Kong, was,
that in defining the time in the contract no allowance was made for the
north-east monsoon on the passage eastward, as is done for the south-west
monsoon on the passage westward. The grievance to the Hong Kong merchants
could, however, have been but of trifling importance, as the steamers,
even when behind contract time, always arrived so as to afford to the China
merchants ample opportunity to answer letters by the return mail. No
complaints from China were made prior to the Company extending the terminus
of the China Line to Bombay, and thereby coming in competition
with the opium clippers in the carrying of that article to Hong Kong.</p></div>

 The tenor of this memorandum is satisfactory in so far as it recognises
the efficiency with which this Company has executed the services contracted
for, and its consequent claim to be continued in the performance of it. But
in two points his lordship has fallen into error:&mdash;</p>

<p>First&mdash;In drawing the conclusion that the mileage rate of payment for one
line of mail service ought to regulate the payment for another line, without
taking into account the various circumstances, such as the amount of commercial
traffic, cost of fuel, &amp;c., on one line as compared with the other.
Had his lordship informed himself on these matters, he would have learned
that it was the large amount of traffic, in the carrying of merchandise to and
from Constantinople and the Black Sea, by those steamers carrying the India
mails to and from Malta, that enabled the Company to carry the mails in the
Mediterranean at so low a rate as 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (or rather, as was actually the rate,
4<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>) per mile, and that such a circumstance formed no criterion of the
rate which would be remunerative on the Southampton and Alexandria line,
where there was no such amount of traffic to meet the expenses.</p>

<p>The second point is in his having mistaken those funds necessary to be
reserved out of earnings to maintain the integrity of the Company’s property,
for an accumulation of capital.</p></div>

 An instance of the value of these contract steamers, otherwise than in
the postal service, occurred at Ceylon, on the breaking out of the insurrection
in that island. The Governor, not having troops sufficient at hand to
quell it, this Company’s contract steamer, “Lady Mary Wood,” (subsidiary
vessel on the China line), proceeded to Madras, and brought up a detachment,
which mainly contributed to the prompt putting down of that insurrection.
The recent destruction of a number of piratical vessels on the
coast of China by this Company’s armed steamer “Canton,” is another
instance of their value on distant stations.</p></div>

 The enormous extent of the correspondence conveyed by this Company’s
steamers may be inferred from the fact that the mail for India and China,
forwarded from Southampton by the “Indus,” on the 20th instant, consisted
of 157 chests, amounting, in bulk, to within a fraction of twenty tons, exclusive
of 13 bags for the Mediterranean. To this must be added the mail
despatched from London on the 24th, <i>viá</i> Marseilles, to be taken up by the
same vessel at Malta, averaging 120 smaller chests. Each of the chests or
cases forwarded <i>viá</i> Southampton is computed to be capable of containing
10,000 single letters; therefore, allowing that a portion of them is occupied
with newspapers, the number of letters must be very great.</p></div></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
